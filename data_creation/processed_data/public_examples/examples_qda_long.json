  "question": "How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- ",
  "document": "But it was not that simple for a father to accept , as she is normal and very keen in learning other things . This made me unrest for few weeks and I had a reasonable doubt , whether she could recognize the colors . This made me mad few days and I was seeking a way to identify . \u201c Can she see the colors that I see ? \u201d was the my first question . Secondly , \u201c Does calling a color with the same name implies that we both see the same ? \u201d . <P> Ultimately , in day to day life no one cares about what you see , but all we call an object as the same color as we were taught to call as . Let me explain how it works \u2026 \u2026 We all have sensors , called photoreceptors or color sensitive cone cells , back of our eyes , that turns light ( electromagnetic waves ) into electrical signal by facilitating to perceive colors by detecting the frequency of the electromagnetic wave . We have many different kinds of these cone cells , and most people have three different photoreceptors for coloured light , which are sensitive to blue , green and red respectively . These three types of photoreceptors allow us to perceive full range of colors . It is actually more accurate , if I say that these photoreceptors are sensitive for short ( blue ) , medium ( green ) and long ( red ) wavelengths of visible light . Source : URL_6 So that , what is sensed is wavelengths rather than colors . This allows someone to raise a reasonable question that , as our eye distinguish wavelengths ( rather than colors ) , should it be interpreted by my brain as exactly same as your brain . <P> So that there is a reasonable question that , as individuals can see colors in a unique way , whether the colors affect the individual \u2019s emotions in a unique way . In other words , do different colors make individual \u2019s state of mind calm & quiet or irritation ? It is true that there is a personal preference with regard to colors ( as one prefer blue but another red ) . But the logic behind the effects of colors on emotions is little different , as actually you do n\u2019t see colors but perceive wavelength of the electromagnetic waves . So that differences in the way we each perceive colors , do n\u2019t change the emotional responses , that we have on them . Regardless of what you actually see when you look at a clear sky , it \u2019s shorter wavelengths ( which we call \u201c blue \u201d ) that tend to make us calm , whereas longer wavelengths ( yellow , orange and red ) make us more alert . Researches suggest an interesting fact that even one can not differentiate colors ( color blind ) still expected to experience a calm and quiet state of mind when looking at the clear sky as the part of the brain which works on the emotions based on the perceived wavelength of the electromagnetic wave . Summary When we are born , our neurons are not configured to respond to color in a default way . <P> It means different combinations , different relative intensities of just three . Any perceived color can be synthesized from three basic colors . \u201d Not all animals have three cones of vision , dogs are known to have only two , while some other animals have more . These animals not only can see more colors than we as humans do , but can \u201c sample \u201d light in different ways than humans , such as infrared and ultra violet light . For now , in our current natural state of being , we ca n\u2019t see them . \u201c Our perception of sound , in one way , is much richer . \u201d Wilczek says . <P> So many colors can be found here at Woodland Park Zoo ! All photos WPZ . But guess what ? Even humans ca n\u2019t actually see all of the colors we perceive ! Take magenta for example . Because magenta , or hot pink , is a mixture of multiple wavelengths , our eyes can not actually distinguish it as a color ; instead , our brain fills in the gaps with what we perceive to be the color magenta . Weird , huh ? That \u2019s a pretty cool trick , but a lot of animals have an even more extreme adaptation of their visual senses , much beyond the limits of human perception . \ufeff This color spectrum shows us visible light , that is , colors most humans can perceive . Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths . Via Science Blogs . If you were to walk past violet on the color spectrum , you would get to ultraviolet rays in the range of 10 \u2013 400 nm . <P> In fact , many bats , nocturnal snakes and lizards have no cones at all , sacrificing the ability to distinguish color for increased absolute sensitivity . Some monochromats might see in ultraviolet , but it \u2019s sort of an unknown . Some dichromats ( animals that have only two types of color receptors ) , such as scorpions , can see UV color . Their cones are built to perceive ultraviolet and green / yellow colors , but they can not see blue , green or red . Most mammals , however , are dichromats , with only red and green receptor cones . As far as trichromats ( humans and some other primates , marsupials , and honeybees ) go , bees have the upper hand in UV vision . They have three receptor types , although unlike humans they are sensitive to ultraviolet light , with loss of sensitivity at the red end of the spectrum . <P> The way that companion animals experience the world around them should influence how we design spaces for their comfort and wellbeing . Let \u2019s start with an understanding of WHY animals perceive their environments differently . Dogs and cats have traded superior perception of color for superior vision in low light conditions . Cats especially have particularly acute vision at night . In contrast , humans do n\u2019t see well in low light , but we do see colors very well . <P> Because cats and dogs can see ultraviolet light , they also see items that fluoresce under UV light , namely materials containing phosphorous ( such as urine ) . Some manmade materials that have had whiteners and brighteners added to them also look different to cats and dogs . These materials may include paper , some plastics , and white fabrics . While we do n\u2019t know for sure that animals respond better to colors they can see , we believe they may . This hunch is supported by some studies . At the very least , it is important to understand how a dog or cat perceives the environment so we can be sensitive to things that may be visually jarring , such as white or clear plastics that glow brightly in the UV spectra that we can not see . In general , it may be best to avoid white or clear plastics in animal environments , particularly in caging . <P> \u201d For a second I thought , Duh , that \u2019s right . Dogs do n\u2019t see color the way we do . But then I remembered that they can distinguish blue from yellow . That \u2019s because while dogs ca n\u2019t see all of the colors we can , they can perceive some differences . While humans have three types of photoreceptors in their eyes that transmit signals about color to the brain , dogs have two types of photoreceptors . We know that these photoreceptors work to transmit information allowing dogs to perceive differences in color because dogs have told us so . Well , sort of . How Have Dogs Told Us That They Perceive Color ? To determine whether dogs can see color , researchers taught dogs to pick the odd - colored circle out of a choice of three circles . So if they showed colors that the dogs could not distinguish , they would fail at the task , but if they chose colors that the dogs could tell apart , the dogs would perform consistently well . Of course . <P> Thanks for your time and patience . I appreciate it ! -Kate Reply Duh says : June 28 , 2017 at 7:30 pm First off , read these article which explains rods and cones well . URL_0 Now , consider this : the 3 different human cones perceive blue , red , or green , as well as millions of \u2018 overlap \u2019 colors , as the article mentions . But dogs have only two types of cones , and they perceive blue or yellow . There also seems to be little to no \u2018 overlap \u2019 colors in a dog \u2019s vision based on their inability to perceive greens . This is all based on very systematic and scientific experimentation combined with our knowledge of human and animal eye anatomy . <P> They like to be around other dogs and maybe even animals , and it is this personality that makes them react to the images on TV . But why the others do n\u2019t ? Again it is probably because they understand that the animals on the TV pose no threat to them in any way , so they are simply not interested . How they react wholly depends on the dog \u2019s personality and how they perceive other animals on TV . Breed To some extent , it also depends on the breed . While some dog breeds are aggressive like German Shepherd , there are other more laidback ones as well . So , this aspect also has a bearing on how dogs react to other animals or dogs on TV . <P> Again , this comes from their genetic traits , but they can see things more quickly than you can ever dream of . For example , images that appear on old TV sets where the number of frames per second is much lesser than modern televisions , is too slow for your dog . In fact , it may appear like a 1920s movie for them ! In addition , dogs have dichromatic vision , which means , they can see and perceive two primary colors namely yellow and blue . Humans , on the other hand , have a trichromatic vision which means we can see and perceive three primary colors namely red , blue and green . This difference makes many images less appealing to your dog because they will not be able to distinguish colors as well as you . This is also why a dedicated HDTV channel called DogTV appeals to dogs . The programs in this channel are really fast and they use only two colors . <P> These will be the short wavelength one , and the medium wavelength , and the long wavelength one . Essentially , you can separate them into the long wavelength is seeing the red color , the medium wavelength is seeing the green color , and short wavelength is seeing the blue color . So that 's how we are capable of seeing the different color , think about that . With this full spectrum , in fact we will be able to perceive a world with all the colors that we are used to . So , if you look at this particular picture , you may see these two birds . They have the yellow , green , blue , and the red color , and we find them they are beautiful . But on the other hand , think about that , a lot of the other animals such as dogs and cats , they have only two photopigment . <P> White is one of the most popular background colors , but \u2026 The Simultaneous Contrast Hypothesis < b > Introduction</b><br > The Simultaneous Contrast hypothesis depends on the on- and off - center receptive fields in the retina and the way they are organized and \u2026 Neuroscience These Cars Are The Same Size Psychologist Richard Wiseman of Quirky Mind Stuff posted this perspective illusion in his blog and told us that the cars are the same size .

A : Quick Answer The trichromatic theory , also referred to as the Young - Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory , is a theory on how humans perceive colors . The theory suggests that the human retina has three receptors for color . Each receptor is sensitive to a different color . One receptor is sensitive to green , one to blue and another to red . <P> - Think Nitesh Home Categories About Contact Privacy Search Search for : Search Think Nitesh Think More \u2022 Imagine Big FacebookTwitterGoogle+ Skip to content Home Categories About Contact Privacy Search Search for : Search How Animals See the World ? Posted by Nitesh Prasad on November 12 , 2017 June 14 , 2018 Science Home Science How Animals See the World ? What is Space ? <P> \u201d [ 1 ] While speculating what animals are thinking is a fantasy , viewing the world through their eyes is quite possible . We can do that by analyzing the properties of animals \u2019 visual systems by the use of some advanced equipment . So , how our favorite pets ( cats , dogs etc . ) , birds , insects and aquatic animals see and perceive this vast and beautiful world ? Let \u2019s analyze their visual systems and other connected sense organs to find out . Dog Vision Human View ( Left ) \u2013 Dog \u2019s View ( Right ) Unlike human beings , dogs have only two types of cone cells so they do n\u2019t see much variety of colors that we see . Their cone cells are sensitive to blue and yellow but not red and green . <P> Snake \u2019s brain merges the heat signals coming from pit organs with information from eyes so that prey \u2019s thermal image is overlaid over the visual one . However , we can easily get an idea what a snake sees by looking through an infrared camera . Fish Vision Human View ( Left ) \u2013 Fish View ( Right ) | ZME Science Fish eyes have both cone and rod cells . They can see different colors just like humans . Some can even see ultraviolet light and some are sensitive to polarized light . Although the eyes of fishes are similar to that of vertebrates , they have a more spherical vision . [ You may have seen fish eye effect in your digital camera . <P> Dogs can hear better than humans and a lot of animals can see different colors then we do . This is because they have a different range than we have . Did you know that taste also has a range ? And that range is n\u2019t the same for everyone . <P> Color keeps things organized and in order . Color does not only help humans but animals as well . Color helps them find food and other resources . Colors have different meanings . For example , some colors are popular in different cultures . Colors also stand for signals . For example , a green traffic light means go , while red means stop . We can associate all different types of colors with different meanings . URL_0 Posted by Amy Rubin at 6:58 AM 4 comments : Rachel Phillips June 8 , 2012 at 10:24 AM This topic was also one of my favorites . I think it is so interesting how we can perceive so many different shades of color . Just looking out the window we can see several different shades of green in all of the different plants . It is truely fascinating that just by mixing two colors together we can expand color by so much . ReplyDelete Olivia Olive June 8 , 2012 at 12:14 PM I think that we are very fortunate to have evolved trichromacy . <P> The essays in Part Four , though written by a less uniformly imposing group of contributors , have the compensating advantage of a unified focus , all revolving around Wittgenstein 's work in philosophical psychology : Hacker offers a detailed account of its career - long development ; Glock proposes a theory of concepts ; Schulte focuses on the early writings ; Schroeder takes up the perceiving of aspects . Out of the vast range of topics and periods canvassed in this volume , I want to single out two interesting claims , both of which , as it happens , pertain to Descartes . First , Gaukroger considers in some detail the question of whether , for Descartes , non - human animals can be said to perceive . His answer is Yes . Whether this is the right answer will surely depend -- as Gaukroger would doubtless agree -- on exactly how we define ' perception . ' Sometimes Descartes applies perceptual language to animals , and sometimes he does not . <P> Gaukroger 's answer is that they can , and that indeed \" no one in the seventeenth century even raised the question of whether animals might not see the world as coloured \" ( p. 245 ) . Whether or not the issue was explicitly discussed , it is certainly an interesting one to consider , if for no other reason than that it has a large bearing on whether we should say that animals perceive at all . After all , when one keeps in mind that the grayscale counts here as a color , it is hard ( though perhaps not impossible ? ) to defend the thesis that animals perceive , but do not in any way perceive colors . If colors are thought to be out in the world , then there seems no in - principle difficulty in allowing other animals to perceive them . ( I will take for granted , following Gaukroger , that in some sense animals do perceive . ) There is a case to be made that Descartes thinks colors are in the world -- after all , he sometimes says this ( e.g. , in the Regulae , the Discourse , the Optics ) -- but the more common reading , accepted by Gaukroger , treats Descartes as denying that colors are in the world . Here is where the question about other animals becomes most interesting . One might suppose that , if colors are not in the world , then surely animals can not perceive them . Consider the case of Galileo , who famously claims that colors reside only \" in consciousness . \" Combine this view with the usual reading of Descartes on which animals are denied consciousness , and it would seem to follow that animals can not perceive colors . Actually , however , what Galileo says in the The Assayer is not that color resides in consciousness , as the standard English translation has it , but that they reside \" nel corpo sensitivo . \" This would seem to leave plenty of room for other animals to perceive colors . What the colors are , on this view , would be physical phenomena within the right sort of perceptual faculties , caused by certain patterns of light in the world . In effect , this is how Gaukroger reads Descartes . On his view , \" the natural world is colourless , \" but color results from the way our eyes physically interact with the surfaces of objects : \" indeed , colour enhancement in visual cognition is a paradigm psycho - physiological operation \" ( p. 245 ) . <P> Even so , I am doubtful whether this is right about Descartes . Certainly , some seventeenth - century authors want to treat colors as conscious , mental phenomena . According to Malebranche , for instance , \" the heat we sense and the colors we see are only in the soul \" ( Search after Truth VI.2.2 ) . Since animals , for Malebranche , have no souls , they can not perceive colors . This seems to be Descartes 's view as well , at least in those places where he wants to locate colors in perceivers rather than in the world . Both the Meditations and the Principles argue that colors , strictly speaking , are not out in the world but are instead our sensations . This much of course leaves open the question of what to say about other animals . <P> It is not hard to see why it seemed important to Descartes ( and others ) to bring colors all the way into the mind , and not only into the sensory organs . A considerable part of what motivates seventeenth - century theories of the secondary qualities is the notion that such qualities are essentially defined in terms of their having a certain sort of phenomenal appearance . But from here it seems to follow quite quickly that nothing outside the mind can possibly have a phenomenal look -- the world does not resemble the mind in these respects . In suggesting that non - conscious animals can perceive colors , Gaukroger ignores this important dimension of the seventeenth - century debate over secondary qualities . The second claim I wish to consider in some detail arises in the course of Marleen Rozemond 's discussion of a much - discussed passage from the Synopsis to the Meditations : The premises that lead to the conclusion that the soul is immortal depend on an account of the whole of physics . This is required for two reasons . First , we need to know that absolutely all substances , or things that must be created by God in order to exist , are by their nature incorruptible and can not ever cease to exist unless they are reduced to nothingness by God 's denying his concurrence to them . <P> Even though Designing with the Mind in Mind is about the human mind , the reading I did to prepare for writing it taught me some things about animal vision as well . For example , I learned that much of what I thought I knew about animals \u2019 color vision was incorrect . Everything I had read about animal vision in my youth suggested that primates \u2014 lemurs , monkeys , apes , and humans \u2014 are the only animals that see colors . All other animals , I had thought , have only brightness - detector cells \u2014 that is , rods \u2014 and , therefore , can not distinguish different colors . Wrong ! It turns out that many different animals , ranging all across the animal kingdom , can see colors . However , this does not mean their color vision works the same way ours does or that they see the same colors we see . There is really no way to know what colors animals see , because color is not an objective property of the world , but rather an artifact of perception \u2014 something the brain constructs to distinguish different frequencies of light . Thus , saying that many animals can perceive color just means that they can distinguish different colors . Usually these are colors that are important to their survival . Some animals can even distinguish more colors than people can . An ability to perceive \u2014 that is , distinguish \u2014 colors requires that an animal \u2019s eyes have more than one type of light sensor , each of which is sensitive to different frequencies of light . If all of an animal \u2019s light sensors are sensitive to the same range of light frequencies , the animal can distinguish only levels of brightness , not colors . Swatches of color that differ only in hue , like those in Figure 1 , would appear the same to such an animal . Figure 1\u2014The top three swatches differ only in hue . <P> But if an animal has two or more different types of light - sensor cells , each sensitive to a different range of light frequencies , that animal probably can distinguish different colors . ( I say probably because some animals behave as though they can not distinguish colors , even though their eyes contain different types of light - sensor cells . ) What may be surprising is that many different animals , from insects to mammals , have two or more types of light detectors . Animals that can see colors include the following : Bees have three types of color detectors in their eyes , so they can distinguish different colors . Unlike ours , their light - detector cells are totally insensitive to low - frequency , or red , light , but are sensitive to ultraviolet light \u2014 higher light frequencies than human eyes can perceive . Therefore , bees can distinguish colors that we can not and vice versa . Some butterflies have between four and six types of photoreceptors and , therefore , can distinguish many more colors than we can . <P> Dogs have two types of cones in their eyes . The sensitivities of their cones are very similar to those of humans who have red - green color - deficient vision . Therefore , do n\u2019t expect a dog to distinguish red from green very well . Animals that can not see colors include the following : Bulls can not see the color of a matador \u2019s red cape . Like all cattle , bulls have only rods in their eyes , so they can not perceive color . In bullfights , bulls respond only to the movement of the matador \u2019s cape . While the capes are red by tradition , they could just as well be purple , pink , or green . <P> New York : Academic Press , 1972 . Smith , Sally E. , ed . , et al . \u201c What Colors Do Animals See ? \u201d WebExhibits / Causes of Color . Retrieved May 28 , 2010 . Waloszek , Gerd . <P> Outside of the other large primates , no other animals possess eyes that are as capable . Some of the raptors can resolve finer objects , but they live in a monochrome world , and lose all the visual information that is encoded in color . Because of our reliance on vision , we tend to think that all other animals , even those with good eyes , are equally dependant upon vision . Such just is n't the case ; for most animals , vision , as we perceive it , is simply irrelevant . Most animals sense their worlds very differently than we do ours . Figure 1 . All of the bristles on this female caprellid amphipod 's body are sensory . <P> Such animals often can not feed or eliminate wastes normally , and they may be subject to abnormal microhabitats with all of their associated problems , such as unusual chemical distributions , lighting patterns , and feeding restrictions , simply because the water flows in a turbulent rather than a laminar manner . And then there are eyes . When most aquarists look at an invertebrate with what appears to be eyes , they see something that is not there . They generally see an animal that they perceive can see them as well as they can see it . With very few exceptions , such a perception is totally false . There are some invertebrates that have camera eyes that have the ability to resolve small difference as well as a vertebrate eye of the same size . Such eyes are found in the cephalopods , such as squids and octopuses , a few snails , and a few polychaete worms . <P> A marine water flea , Evadne . The units of the compound eye are visible to the right . The black area is the region of the photoreceptor chemicals , but the tubular nature of the compound eye units or ommatidia extends upward from this region . Many of these animals with compound eyes can see colors . In some cases they can even see the same ones we do . On the other hand , some animals have a decidedly different way of looking at the world . Color vision is the result of the brain integrating the responses of visual pigments , called rhodopsins , each responding to distinctly different wavelengths of light . <P> Vertebrate eyes are indirect eyes , the photoreceptor cells , the rods and the cones , face away from the incoming light and in effect respond to the light bouncing off a reflective layer at the back of the retina called the tapetum . This reflective layer is differently colored in various vertebrates and is what is responsible for the various colors that vertebrate eyes reflect in the dark . Be that as it may , the camera eye of cephalopods and vertebrates produce images in much the same manner . However , the two groups of animals do not perceive the same image in the same manner . Much of the processing of an image is done by neural units , sort of like subprocessors , that integrate the responses from the photoreceptor cells , prior to the responses being sent to the brain . The neural subprocessors , or retinal ganglion cells , of the cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are connected to their receptor cells in decidedly different manners . This results in an image of the same object being perceived of differently . <P> And some other mammals even see yellow and blue the way humans do . Why is color perception different between animals and us humans ? The scientists would say it \u2019s because a human \u2019s retinas contain more distinct types of cones , the photoreceptor neurons in the retina that convert light into color by absorbing photons of varying wavelengths . The variances in photon absorption between the different cone types allow the human brain to perceive a myriad colors . OK , that \u2019s the mildly technical explanation . But who \u2019s to say that you truly see colors the way I do ? Think about it . <P> of Color in Nature Author Valerie Rose Kessler Date of Award 6 - 2018 Document Type Restricted ( Opt - Out ) Degree Name Bachelor of Science Department Neuroscience First Advisor Leo Fleishman Language English Keywords goldfish , vision , tetrachromat , visual system , lower vertebrates Abstract Many animals , including humans , have evolved the use of color vision . It can not be assumed , however , that animals perceive or detect color in the same way that humans do . This study aimed to both test the feasibility of goldfish as a viable model for studying animal color vision , and to address questions about perception of color in nature by animals . We were particularly interested in assessing the role that color contrast \u2013 the difference between the color of an object and its background \u2013 plays in making objects more or less visible . We were interested in determining whether goldfish exhibit color categorization : the tendency to perceive certain different colors as fundamentally similar , and if it is similar to the same process in humans . <P> 24 , 2018 , 2:11 PM Mikhail Klyoshev / Shutterstock The way we see colors is n't the same from person to person , even though we tend to think color palettes are pre - determined . Color perception is largely determined by the language you speak because of the many nuances of identifying objects across cultures . Most of the world 's languages have five basic color terms , others divide all colors by \" light \" and \" dark , \" while others categorize the color blue into lighter and darker shades . The human eye can physically perceive millions of colors . But we do n't all recognise these in the same way . Some people ca n't see differences in \u2014 so called color blindness \u2014 due to a defect or absence of the cells in the retina that are sensitive to high levels of light : the cones . But the distribution and density of these cells also varies across people with \" normal vision \" causing us all to experience the same color in slightly different ways . <P> How color vision works Human can distinguish colors when incoming light reacts with the cone cells in the retina of eye . There are three types of cone cells . Based on how they respond to light of wavelengths you will perceive the three basic colors ; red , green and blue . The rest of the colors are perceived as a result of your brain combining the different cone cells . Often it is claimed that women distinguish colors better than men . This is partly true since 2 - 3 % of women have also fourth type of cone cells instead of the normal three . <P> For a color blind person some colors look misleadingly similar . The most common form of color blindness is deuteranomaly , a difficulty to distinguish red and green . Please notice that on this page you ca n't test color blindness , but your ability to differiate color tones . How animals see colors Birds are famous for their excellent eyesight . Their eyes can see even five basic colors and the number of different color combinations is vast . Bees and many other insects can see ultraviolet light . That helps them to notice which plants are full of nectar and need pollination . <P> This is a color vision deficiency which is found in about 6 % of the male population . A person with deuteranopia has a problem seeing green and/or red colors , therefore their color spectrum is different from that of other people . Which means their interpretation of the color green / red and therefore the world in general is also different . Another example can be animals , in that a lot of them do not have the ability to see colors , therefore also their world image is also different . On the other hand , a lot of animals can hear sounds which are impossible to hear for the human ear , they often also have a better sense of smell than humans do . So humans perceive some things animals do not , and vice versa . Our senses are also a subject of change ...

The evolution of knowledge is mostly because of sense perception . <P> There are so many times when our senses can be influenced by instinct , emotion , and beliefs . For example , if we are in the middle of a forest and scared , we probably start to see and hear things that are n\u2019t there . This shows that our senses are not dependable enough to give us a true representation of our surroundings . Different people perceive things differently , so how can we rely on incompatible abilities to give us a clear and consistent perception ? Different species view the world differently . Birds can see ultraviolet light , some fish like whales use SONAR for location , and some beetles make use of the earth \u2019s magnetic field to locate their nests . There are so many senses that are still unknown and none of us have experienced , so how can we decide which one gives the best representation of reality ? <P> And there is still no answer for my most important question . Maybe you have one ? \u2014 Why is color blindness still such a common disease ? Can Dogs see Colors ? February 27 , 2007 Animals The question if dogs are colorblind , specifically red - green colorblind or if dogs only see shades of gray is raised among dog owners quite often . Even on the internet the question concerning dog vision is discussed controversial . But there is a simple answer to that question which I would like to share with you supported by some scientific resources . <P> Dogs can see colors Dogs not only see in shades of gray but also can see distinct colors contrary to what most people belief . About one hundred years ago some scientific tests were made to find out more about the color vision of dogs . But these tests were n\u2019t that scientific as they thought and the researchers concluded only that color vision does n\u2019t play a part in the daily life of a dog . Only about 90 years later distinct researches have shown that dogs can perceive colors . Neitz , Geist and Jacobs researched in 1989 the color vision of domestic dogs and found the following facts : Dogs have two different color receptors in their eyes and therefore are dichromats . One color receptor peaks at the blue - violet range , the other at the yellow - green range . Conclusion : Dogs are green - blind which is one form of red - green color blindness also called deuteranopia . <P> Because of that any kind of color vision deficiency is called color blindness . Therefore dogs are colorblind because of their dichromatic color vision . Colors dogs ca n\u2019t distinguish Actually the color spectrum made up of wavelengths of light is the same to all of us . Only the perception of those colors can be quite different . As dogs only have two different color receptors in their eyes they have problems to distinguish certain colors : Red \u2014 Orange \u2014 Green Greenish Blue \u2014 Gray Different shades of Purple The list is not completed and there are a lot of different shades which ca n\u2019t be differentiated if you are colorblind . And the conclusion is dogs can see colors but are at the same time colorblind . More facts on the vision of dogs can be found in the book Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training , Vol . <P> places on Earth You wo n't believe these 10 facts about people Top 10 facts about the world Can you see through these real - life optical illusions ? A cone cell or simply \u201c cone \u201d is a specialized light - sensitive cell found in the retina of the eye and used for discrimination of color and detail . In humans , three cone cell types are present , sensitized to different ranges of wavelength to provide a range of color perception . Different organisms have varying numbers of cones , sensitized to different areas of the spectrum , allowing animals like bees to perceive infrared light while humans can not . As the name suggests , part of the shape of a cone cell is indeed like that of a cone . The cone - shaped segment sits on top of the cell and reacts to different wavelengths of light , depending on the concentration of photopigment present in the structure . As this structure reacts , it sends a signal to the main body of the cone cell , and the input from scores of cone cells is used to create a complete picture for the brain . <P> Relative End Points The end points of the spectrum presented above are with respect to the human eye . Many animals can see beyond the human limits of electromagnetic wavelengths . Their visibility range extends into what we call the infrared or ultraviolet range . Bees can perceive in the ultraviolet range . In that sense , the visible wavelength limits are subjective or relative . What we see as colors are our optical system 's and brain 's response to a particular set of electromagnetic waves . So , wavelengths are an absolute concept but colors can be subjective to the visual system . <P> Color Vision in dogs Dogs are not color blind , but they have poor color vision . In comparison to humans , dogs not only see fewer colors but also a more faded version of the colors we see . A dog \u2019s eye contains more rod shaped cells than cone cells . Fewer cone cells are the reason why dogs perceive colors lighter than they exist . In addition to this , a dog \u2019s eyes contain only two of the three types of cone shaped photoreceptors . Thus , they see only certain colors of the color spectrum and are said to have dichromatic vision . So , which are the different colors a dog can see ? Researchers state that dogs can identify shades of grey , selected shades of blue and shades between brown to yellow on the color spectrum . Dogs can not distinguish between reds and greens and perceives them as shades of grey . Color Vision in other animals Color vision in cats , rabbits , mice and rats is similar to the color vision in dogs . <P> They do not see as good as humans but it is enough to help them with activities such as finding their food or identifying predators . You will be surprised to learn about the members of the animal kingdom who have a very well develop spectrum of color vision . They are the birds , bees and the butterflies . They not only view the world in color , but are able to perceive even those colors not visible to humans . Like 1 Thanks ! You ' ve already liked this \u00ab Is the Ferret a Pet for You ? \u00bb How do Parrots Talk ? <P> The initial research that I did was in collaboration with Eli Brenner ( see : URL_1 /ebrenner/ ) and Jeroen Smeets ( see : URL_1 / jsmeets/ ) . Recently I investigated the role of eye movements in the chromatic induction ( simulatneous color contrast ) and color constancy . This research was done in collaboration with Matteo Toscani ( see : URL_0 ) and Karl Gegenfurtner ( see : URL_4 ) . Remarkably we know very little about how what we look at influences how we perceive colors . Below you can see an example of a stimulus that we used for studying the effects of eye movements on color constancy . Observers see a virtual scene containing a checkerboard and spheres under one illuminant in scene A and a similar scene ( scene B ) under a different illuminant place at the opposite site of a computer monitor . The task for observers is to match the color of one colored square in the checkerboard of scene A to the color of another square in scene B ( color constancy ) . <P> This is the question we want to address here : how does the color of an object interact with its material properties ( like gloss and roughness ) under changes in the chromaticity of the illumination ? There are few previous studies on this topic . This work is done in collaboration with Romain Vergne ( see : URL_2 ) . My work shows that how we perceive colors depend on the material properties of the object itself . Perceiving object colors under changes in illumination and backgrounds : Under normal circumstances , the color sof objects do n't change much under changes in both background and the illumination . However , there are circumstances for which we predict that our mind ( or brain ) might be fooled when estimating the color of an object . For example , photo cameras are mostly fooled when the illumination is strongly shifted towards a certain color ( for example during sunset ) or when the color of the background is biased ( see examples below ) . However , my research shows that even for scenes which are biased towards certain colors , the mind is not influenced by this bias when estimating surface colors . A remarkable accomplishment ! Perceiving colors in ' the real world ' : Mostly colors are studied in the laboratory under very artificial conditions . My reserach involves how we perceive colors in ' the real world ' . Under daily circumstances , we are not fooled by differences in changes in background color or under changes in illumination ( eg . , when the illumination changes from daylight to artifcial tungsten light to filtered light ) ; see examples below . <P> These cells are responsible for the perception of colors . ArtHearty Staff Last Updated : Mar 19 , 2018 Quick Fact It is estimated that the average human eye can distinguish about ten million colors from one another ! In 1802 , Thomas Young proposed that there are three types of photoreceptor cells in the eyes of humans and other primates . These cells allow the eye to perceive colors and differentiate between them . Hermann von Helmholtz further developed this theory in 1850 , stating that the cone photoreceptor cells of three types are sensitive to different wavelengths of light . They can be classified as short - preferring , middle - preferring , and long - preferring , based on their response to different wavelengths . The short , middle , and long - preferring cells correspond to the blue , green and red regions of the color spectrum , respectively . <P> Humans and some other mammals are trichromats . A recent study showed that marsupials possess trichromatic vision . Some insects are trichromats ; for example , honeybees that can distinguish between ultraviolet , blue and green light . How Trichromats Perceive Colors ? Color vision is the ability of an organism to distinguish between colors . Cone cells in the retina of the eye , are responsible for color vision . They are photoreceptor cells sensitive to different wavelengths of light . <P> Psychologists say that color perception happens when the neurons in the brain are stimulated . These neurons react to various characteristics of the perceived object like edges , angles , patterns , movement , and luminosity . Color Blindness Monochromacy refers to the condition of having only one channel to convey color information . In this case , an individual can not distinguish between colors and is unable to perceive the difference in brightness of colors . This condition can result from complete absence of cone cells or presence of only one type of cone cells . Lacking any one type of cone cells leads to a condition called dichromacy . Lack of short - wavelength cones is termed as tritanopia , lack of medium - wavelength cones is referred to as deuteranopia and lack of long - wavelength cones is called protanopia . <P> How can they discriminate colors in their environment or on the coats of their conspecifics ? This problem has puzzled researchers for decades . Recently , Alexander and Christopher Stubbs ( 2016 ) proposed a model that could explain this phenomenon . According to the Stubbs , cephalopods have a mechanism for detecting different colors unlike any other animals . Their theory is based on the observation that the shape of the pupil of these animals maximizes chromatic blurring through their lens . Light of different colors has different wavelengths and will converge at a different point on the retina when going through a lens . Humans and many other animals do not suffer from this because the shape of our lens minimizes chromatic blurring onto our retina . <P> Which Color Has the Shortest Wavelength ? What Colors Make White Paint ? Related Videos Full Answer The spectrum of visible light runs from violet to red . It is banded on either side by ultraviolet and infrared , colors which human beings can not perceive unassisted . Red light has the longest wavelength with about 650 nm . There are many other colors which human beings can not perceive but which are measurable through instrumentation . Other colors of the spectrum and their wavelengths include : Orange light with a wavelength of roughly 590 nm . Yellow light with a wavelength of roughly 570 nm . Blue light with a wavelength of roughly 475 nm . <P> Visible light is the light that corresponds with a light wavelength of 400 - 700 nanometers . Violet has the shortest wavelength and red has the longest wavelength of visible light . Infrared light has a longer wavelength than visible , red light . Infrared light falls outside the scope of what is considered visible light for humans , although some other animals can perceive light outside of this range . Rainbows When tiny water droplets are in the air , they can act as miniature prisms . Much like what happens when light passes through the triangular glass or plastic , when light passes through a water droplet , a spectrum of light can be created in the sky . As light enters a raindrop , it slows down , because light is slower in water than in air . The light bounces off the back of the raindrop and exits the raindrop , however , the light speeds up and is once again , refracted as it exits the droplet . Rainbows are created when light enters a water droplet and the light is refracted or bent , then reflects on the side and is refracted again , as the light exits . What do animals see ? Can other animals see colors ? Do they see more or less color than humans ? While we ca n\u2019t say for sure , scientists can count the numbers of cones in an animal \u2019s eye and the position of the cones , in relation to the retina , to make educated guesses about the number of colors and how strongly the color might be seen . Spiders , bees , and many other insects can see an additional color that humans can not see \u2014 ultraviolet . <P> There are honestly not a lot of environments or species for which Fusion is not well - suited . ASAT Photo Credit : Cooper Images ASAT stands for \u201c All Season , All Terrain \u201d and is intended to be used in any environment at any time . This is based on the use of multiple shades of brown to create depth that can blend well in many environments . It is effective for ungulate hunting due to the colors being in the range they do not perceive . it is also effective because of the way it breaks up the human silhouette . However , because the appearance is so drastically different from many environments , it may not be the best choice for hunting some species in some environments .

As soon as you \" see'- ' this outline of light , notice the color . These auric colors do not stand still , but vibrate or radiate , swirling in and out upon themselves , or as a fluctuating light flashing bright and dim . See just how far your \" inner vision \" can perceive this aura . The aura itself will grow dim with distance . These colors will be the key to the emotions connected to what people or animals are thinking about . Practice this until you can automatically see the aura at will . <P> By the way , a lot of encoded information is contained in the music that many animals sing . Even if you are not able to decode the information right away , know that your higher Self knows it all and that your subconscious will store the information for its usage when appropriate . As you elevate your personal frequency , you become more sensitive . Thus , you may perceive sounds and colors that remained inaudible and invisible to you before . Many of you will be called to visit physical places on the planet in order to re - connect to the ancient knowledge and to upload new frequencies and information to serve your life \u2019s purpose . Everything exists beyond space and time , and everything is recorded beyond past , present , and future .

Some have very poor color vision and others have very good color vision . In fact some birds and bees have super color vision and see colors that humans do n't see . Poor Color Vision and Animals Dogs , cats , mice , rats and rabbits have very poor color vision . <P> In some cases it 's not as good as what we humans see - but it 's much better than cats and dogs . Scientists say that good color vision helps animals find food on the land or in the water . For land animals , good color vision helps to tell the difference between ripe red fruit and unripe green fruit . Colors can also make animals more attractive to each other when they mate . Finally , the ability to see colors helps animals identify predators ( other animals who may attack them ) . Who has super color vision ? Bees and butterflies can see colors that we ca n't see . <P> It 's the gecko and it can tell blue from grey ! It 's possible that frogs might also see some colors when it 's dark . Source How do we know what colors an animal sees ? Although there 's no way to truly know what non - human animals actually perceive , scientists can examine the cones inside the eyes and estimate what colors an animal sees . One of the techniques used to determine the color vision of fish is \u201c microspectrophotometry . \u201d This process analyzes the visual pigments and photo - sensitivity of cells in order to determine how and what colors a fish sees . For more information , see Look Inside the Eye Scientists also test for color vision with behavioral tests . <P> Human Vision Tag - Team : Rods and Cones Two of the most important types of cells involved in making vision possible are rods and cones . Cones , in human eyes , come in three varieties : red , green , and blue light sensitive . These cells are what allow us to see sharp , detailed images full of color . The reason some people are colorblind is that they \u2019re missing one of the types of cones , which limits the range of colors they can perceive . The biggest weakness of cones is that they only work with a lot of light . Any darker than about the brightness of the night of a half moon and the cones ca n\u2019t function . That \u2019s where the rods come in . <P> By having four pigments avaible they would be able to see a wider range and variety of color that most people can not . I heard about this from a radio show called \" Radiolab \" which was running an entire program with color as a topic . For example they also discussed how cultures may not perceive a color as easily when they do not have a word for it than when they do have a word for a certain color . The labeling of the word , to some extent , affects how we perceive colors . One doctor raised her daughter teaching her all the colors . She made sure that no one ever asked her daughter what color the sky was . Every week they would go for a walk and her mother would point to objects and ask what color they are and the little girl would reply green , yellow , red etc . <P> However , once the word red is written in green ink , synesthetes take even slower to identify the color green because it remains hidden under the colors red , yellow , and gray . This shows that synesthesia is involuntary and instantaneous . In a separate study , synesthetes were shown hidden characters in a puzzle . Because synesthetes perceive different colors with different characters , five out of six synesthetes were able to identify the hidden character quicker than the six people in the control group . Alternatively , synesthetes have trouble identifying hidden characters when they perceive them to be the same color as the background they are placed in . This ultimately shows grapheme - color synesthesia is not only real , but it can also provide a cognitive advantage or disadvantage . An example of a \u201c Standard Stroop Paradigm . <P> Therefore , scientists asked synesthetes to describe the colors they associate with different letters of the alphabet every year . Surprisingly , 90 % of individuals were consistent with their perceptions . But even more surprisingly , the colors synesthetes described were extremely specific . Because there are not many \u201c basic \u201d colors , synesthetes perceive different characters with different shades of colors that most people would name as the same color ( like cobalt and blue ) . However , synesthetes are very specific with the shades of color they describe , marking an outstanding difference in their perception of each character ( 3 ) . Surprisingly , capitalization and fonts influence the colors synesthetes perceive . Synesthetes perceive lowercase letters as less saturated than uppercase letters . They also perceive vivid colors from a prototypical font ( Times New Roman and Arial ) but perceive stronger colors from \u201c weird \u201d fonts ( Gothic ) . It is theorized that a capital letter or an unusual font hyper - stimulates graphene neurons because they take more energy to visualize and understand , leading to a stronger cross - modal stimuli perception . <P> I ' ve always had this notion : what if people actually see different colors ? What if what I perceive as red is in fact perceived as blue by someone else ? And what if although we perceive them differently , since in language they have the same word , we never notice and think they are the same color ? Or how can you be sure that what you perceive as red is the same kind of red someone else sees ? Think about it that way : We know that language is arbitrary right ? Which means there is no connection between the sound and the actual object it represents ( in this case the color ) . For example , there is no connection between the word \" table \" which is a combination of sounds ( or if you know linguistics a little , phonemes ) and the actual object \" table \" which we have dinner on . <P> But , since they have different words for them , it is much easier for them to spot the difference . However , they have the same word for blue and green . And while we can distinguish blue and green rather easily , they have a hard time doing that . In other words , they actually perceive colors differently than we do . And how cool is that ?

What 's the difference between \" socially objective value \" and \" subjective value \" in a free market economy ? <P> Both lenses separate colors , like a magnifying lens does . This separation shows as color splitting on your retina . In fact , if you use a microscope to look at a person 's retina while they look at a bright white thread on a black velvet background , its image away from the center of sight is tinged Red , and towards the center is tinged blue . Paradoxically , the person looking at the thread does n't perceive these colors . In the retinal image of the white TV pixel , Airy disks separation is evidence that color splitting happens for the three wavelengths produced by TVs . The general diffraction paradox Now consider light going through a slit . In high school science , you were shown the \" two slit \" photon experiment . <P> Well , you could obviously take a bite and tell , but most of the times , you can tell just by looking . Especially if we\u0411re talking about rotten bananas . A raw banana would look green , a ripe one would be yellow and a rotten one is most likely blackened . Have you wondered how we know the difference between these different colors ? Let\u0411s find out . What are Colors ? All the colors we perceive are an effect of light . The seemingly colorless sunlight actually contains all the colors we can see , but at different wavelengths . In fact , color itself , is light of a particular wavelength , reflected . When sunlight falls on an object , the surface of the object absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest of it . <P> So say the object is a ripe banana , it would absorb all the wavelengths of light except the ones that correspond to the color yellow . And we would thus see that a banana is yellow . This property of the object changes as the object changes , which is why a raw banana would look green , and a rotting banana would appear blackish . Why do we see different Colors ? How do we know which color is which , i. e. how does our brain know the difference between these colors ? We have a tiny area called the fovea centralis all the way at the back of our eyes that is responsible for us seeing color . This area has millions of light receptors called cones and rods which react to light and tell our brains what colors we see . <P> They send the message across to our brain via our optic nerves , which processes the information and tells us what color we\u0411re looking at . And we then know whether the banana is raw , ripe , or rotting . The rods in our eyes are active in low - light environments , where cones fail to perform , but they perceive black and white , which is why it becomes difficult to determine the color of objects at night , or in very dim lighting . How are Colors and Wavelengths related ? You now know that different colors have different wavelengths . The human brain can only recognize colors that have wavelengths within the visible spectrum . Colors that have wavelengths that are either less or more than this visible spectrum are invisible to us . <P> Integration and DNA activation During the previous years and more and more at this time , there is great emphasis on DNA repair and activation as well as the integration of all aspects of the Higher Self into our current incarnation . But how does this process take place ? Once we can understand the energy flows in our aura and bodies then the rest is not so complicated although it is a very complex process due to the amount of information carried in each particle of energy that makes up our whole being as well as the transcendence of time and space in the multiple dimensions in which our being exists , which is very different to the way we perceive them in our physical world . Since our aura is composed of so many energies with different frequencies we can see it as a beautiful jewel full of colors and movements , so the fragments that separated from it can also be perceived at times as very colorful energies moving constantly . When we are doing a healing session or the solar energies assist us naturally , then the energies move like waves and sometimes we could see them similar to the following drawings : The second and third drawings display how a person receives incoming energies that belong to his / her aura in such a way that they form a vortex of multidimensional and colorful energies . <P> But what the video is actually about , and what \u2019s awesome , is how we perceive color . Inside our eyeballs , along the back surface , we have rod and cone - shaped cells that form the retina . When the cone cells of the retina are excited by light pouring in through the pupil , they send electrical signals to the brain . And we perceive specific colors based on what mix of signals are sent to the brain . The cones in humans are normally only sensitive to three colors : red , blue and green because the three types of cones we have are sensitive to red , blue and green wavelengths of light . Some females can have additional cones that are sensitive to another wavelength of light thanks to a genetic anomaly . There is an excellent Radiolab episode about color which features a woman with tetrachromacy . <P> What is the difference between mimicry and camouflage question date : 2013 - 09 - 11 : answer 1 : mimicry and camouflage are similar both are types of shapes and colors that trick animals .

You have 80 million rods and only 5 million cones .",
  "answer": "Larger animals ( including humans ) have special cells in the back of their eyes called cone cells . Each type of cone cell reacts to a specific wavelength : that is , light whose color corresponds to a specific part of the rainbow . When the cell is hit by light with the right wavelength , it sends a signal to the brain , which combines information from all of the cone types to perceive the full color range . What colors each animal sees depends on the number of different cone types , and what wavelength they react to . For example , most humans have three cell types which perceive violet , green , and yellow , but some of us lack one of these types , leading to green - red color - blindness . Some species of bird or fish on the other hand have four different cell types , giving them a very different perception of colors ."

  "document": "The Woodwind Section Woodwinds include the flute , the clarinet , the oboe and the bassoon . Depending on the size of the orchestra , there can be up to four of each instrument being played . Each woodwind is played by blowing into them and fingering different holes to produce a different sound . Most of these instruments are made with wood . Flutes can be made either with wood or metal , though those used in an orchestra are usually made of metal . While it can technically be classified as a brass instrument , it is still closer to woodwinds .

Woodwind musical instrument Written By : The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica See Article History Woodwind , any of a group of wind musical instruments , composed of the flutes and reed pipes ( i.e. , clarinet , oboe , bassoon , and saxophone ) . Both groups were traditionally made of wood , but now they may also be constructed of metal . Woodwinds are distinguished from other wind instruments by the manner in which the sound is produced . Unlike the trumpets or other instruments of the brass family , in which the airstream passes through the player \u2019s vibrating lips directly into the air column , the flutes are sounded by directing a narrow stream of air against the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube . With the reed pipes ( e.g. , clarinets and saxophones ) , a thin strip of flexible material , such as cane or metal , is placed against the opening of the mouthpiece , forcing the airstream to pass through the reed before it reaches the column of air that is to vibrate . <P> The fact that some modern woodwinds , such as flutes and saxophones , are made of metal whereas several ancestors of present - day brasses , such as the cornett and the \u2026 instrumentation Woodwinds : three flutes , piccolo , three oboes , English horn ( cor anglais ) , three clarinets , bass clarinet , three bassoons , contrabassoon ( double bassoon ) . \u2026 musical sound : Aerophones Woodwinds prior to the 20th century were made for the most part of wood . Today the flutes and clarinets are classified in this group only because of this heritage , while the saxophones , always built of metal , share only the reed mouthpiece and similar fingering technique \u2026 Claude Debussy : Evolution of his work Similarly , he saw that woodwinds need not be employed for fireworks displays ; they provide , like the human voice , wide varieties of colour . Debussy also used the brass in original colour transformations . In fact , in his music , the conventional orchestral construction , with its rigid woodwind , brass , and string departments , finds \u2026 orchestra \u2026 orchestra : four sections , consisting of woodwinds ( flutes , oboes , and bassoons ) , brass ( horns and trumpets ) , percussion ( two timpani ) , and strings ( first and second violins <P> Why not ?

We do not work on these instruments because they are more trouble than they 're worth . DO NOT BUY THEM . <P> Ask your friends and neighbors . They may have clarinets or flutes that their kids played in school but gave up on . Check local tag sales or church bazaars . Classified ad newspapers will often have them .

There is a variety of woodwind musical instruments but normally they have two common attributes such as made of wood and create the melodious sound by causing the blowing air within the given area . These musical instruments contain some resonator in which the player blows air through the mouthpiece , and then this air causing vibration , this vibration causes music . The quality of sound is determined by the size of the tube as well as the modifications that are changed manually . In some cases , the sound of wind musical instruments is produced through the vibration of air in the given space or some produced through a blowing read . Nowadays Wood musical instruments are not only made of wood material but they are also developed with the use of other materials such as a combination of wood , plastic or metal . Basically , they all contain tapered cylinders or pipes with a hole , which is opening at the bottom end . The bottom end is used to blow air through the mouthpiece , and holes are used to change the pitch of the sound such as opening and closing the holes through your fingers . History Of WoodWinds There are a lot of origins of wind instruments because they are found to be widely scattered around the world . <P> It is not wrong if it is saying to be the first instruments created by human . However , the first instrument created in the family of wind is a flute . The other kinds of wind family such as that are using reeds was created around 10,000 BC . The Wood Wind Instruments Family The woodwinds instruments are also classified according to their sizes , shapes , and different pitches . The woodwind having smaller sizes can produce higher pitches while the instruments having the larger size can produce lower notes . However , they have been classified into different kinds that are given below . Flute Oboe Clarinet The Flutes The flutes are one of the most popular musical instruments that belong to the wind family . The musical instruments are originally made from wind , hollow reeds , and stones . Now a day some modern flute made from silver or platinum . <P> Single reed woodwinds include the saxophone and clarinet . Double reed woodwinds have two reeds , and include the oboe , English horn , and bassoon . Some ethnic woodwinds have even more reeds , with up to four . Some of these woodwinds are made from wood , but most of them include metallic elements , or are made entirely from metal . Although some woodwinds could be confused with brass instruments , since they are made entirely from metal , they have a very different sound . The sound is not directional , and it is much softer and less aggressive . Most orchestras have a combination of woodwinds and brass instruments to achieve a rich blend of sound , combining the more delicate sound of woodwinds with the harsher tones of brass instruments . Many musicians are capable of picking up both woodwinds and brass , since the basic skills needed to play them are very similar . <P> At first glance , the piccolo looks like a miniature replica of the flute . On closer inspection , however , various differences are evident . First , there is the material used for the body . While most flutes are made of metal , nowadays the majority of piccolos are made of wood . This is because the piccolo has a higher register , and metal piccolos can sound too piercing and therefore not blend well with other instruments . Second , the main tube of the piccolo is cone - shaped ( conical ) , tapering off toward the tip . The flute used to be the same shape , until Theobald Boehm adopted the fixed - thickness cylinder in the nineteenth century , establishing this new profile . <P> Most woodwinds have keys which cover up holes in the body of the instrument , changing the size of the air column contained inside and thus altering the tone . Some woodwinds , like flutes , just have the fingerholes and do n't actually use reeds at all , it being played in the same manner as your beer bottle when you blow across the top after a few . The department of the orchestra which comprises all of the wind instruments save for the horns and heavy brass . Woodwinds are rarely made out of wood anymore , but when the term was coined , they all were . To the uninitiated this sometimes causes confusion since most woodwinds are made out of metal ( and in some cases , plastic ) like the flute ; also , the saxophone has been invented since this term came to be and they have never been made out of wood . But fear not ! I promise to make these noble instruments easy to understand . Woodwinds are a vital and necessary part of any orchestra , as it is extremely rare to find a piece which omits the woodwind section all together . <P> Dependent upon the size of this orchestra , there will be up so that you can four of instrument to be played . Each woodwind might be played by way of blowing towards them and even fingering numerous holes to generate a different noise . Most for these instruments are built with hardwood . Flutes are usually made as well with real wood or alloy , though those applied to an orchestra are typically made in metal . Even though it can technologically be classified being brass application , it continues closer to be able to woodwinds . Flutes happen to be blown out of your side of this instrument as opposed to the end of your instrument but it produces a top , clear sensible . The sensible itself might either become piercing or simply extremely mellow . <P> Send me some reed money . Thanks ! $ Buy my book : Woodwind Basics Does material affect tone quality in woodwind instruments ? : Why scientists and musicians just ca n\u2019t seem to agree Most woodwind players would be surprised if you asked them whether the material from which their instrument is made affects its sound . Certainly!\u2014most would reply . An inexpensive nickel - plated flute has a tone lacking in character and brilliance , but a fine silver flute sounds , well , silvery ! It has a tone that sparkles , that sings , that carries to the back of the concert hall . <P> . . . What has been said of ebonite may be said of metal . . . . <P> The stuff you hear about material is mostly marketing , and very few companies agree whether silver helps give you a bright sound or a dark sound , so we all tend to take that with a pinch of salt . Reply Ricardo Faissal November 19th , 2010 \u201c Maybe some musicians have spent time enough with instruments to be able to feel the 1 to 2 percent difference that scientists proved does exist , but ca n\u2019t feel , between instruments of different materials . \u201d Reply John Malmstrom December 14th , 2010 A few years ago , I purchased a vintage metal clarinet to serve as an emergency back - up for my trusty Buffet R-13 . I did some research and found that there \u2019s a range of quality in metal clarinets , like any other instrument and I found one that might be classified as a low - pro level horn . I \u2019 ve asked my friends close their eyes and identify which one I was playing \u2014 no one could tell . It \u2019s a fun instrument to play \u2014 and it \u2019s real shiny ! Recent blog post : A little self promotion \u2026 ( November 18 , 2010 ) Reply Nathan Zalman March 1st , 2011 An former teacher of mine , bassoonist Ted Lapina , played a plastic Polisi bassoon while I knew him at Shenandoah . <P> Basic acoustics tells us that the woodwind instrument is merely a container for the real sound - producing body \u2014 a vibrating column of air . \u201d True enough , but the material that sets the vibration in motion and the material against which the vibrating air moves does affect the quality of the sound . Consider a gong . Would it sound the same if made of plastic ? No ! It \u2019s the brass of the gong that initiates the vibration of the surrounding air , giving it the quality of the sound that you hear . The fallacy of Coltman \u2019s experiment with flute tubes of different materials was his use of a plastic headjoint . <P> No ! It \u2019s the brass of the gong that initiates the vibration of the surrounding air , giving it the quality of the sound that you hear . \u201d In case of woodwind instruments the material that sets the vibration in motion is the wooden reed mounted on your mouthpiece . Destpite of the fact that the saxophone is made of brass which is metal , it is categorised as woodwind instrument , because the sound vibration is created by a wooden reed . The material of which a woodwind instrument is made only shapes the sound column . When the soundwave leaves the instrument it has certain wavelenght and frequency . And these two properties are not affected by the body material of the woodwind instrument . <P> Also , I can attest that Legere reeds can sound and play better on some mouthpieces than others . Reply Jonathan March 17th , 2012 For a very interesting read about the use of wood and clarinets , see Tom Ridenour \u2019s piece called \u201c The Grenadilla Myth \u201d : URL_0 Reply rick March 19th , 2012 I \u2019d like to expand on the paragraph that starts with : \u201c Materials may affect they way an instrument sounds before anyone ever plays it \u2014 by affecting the way the instrument is made . \u201d I have read that wooden flutes sound different than metal ones because of the extra thickness of the wood and the manner in which the tone holes are made . Metal flutes have collars either drawn or soldered around the holes , but the holes on wooden flutes are drilled into the material and the surrounding material is level with the hole . I do n\u2019t know how that could translate into a sound difference , but it \u2019s an example of the material affecting the way the instrument is made . Reply john May 21st , 2012 I completely disagree however I am sure scientifically that there are materials that would result in the same quality of tone that is made with less desirable metals and woods when it comes to certain materials \u2026 the resonance vibrating factors and quality of craftsmanship play the most important role \u2026 Reply ted lapina March 24th , 2013 <P> ( Or does it ? ) Related post More on the science / fiction of woodwind materials Photo , ~Bob ~ West~ There \u2019s an interesting woodwind - related post by blogger \u201c MarkCC \u201d at Good Math , Bad Math , entitled \u201c My Newest Flute , made of \u2026 Plastic ? ! \u201c MarkCC recently acquired a new flute of the type used in Irish traditional music , the kind that are most often made of wood .

In this installment ( and those to come ) , we \u2019ll dig into some real doubling stuff . Instruments Q : Which woodwind instruments do you play , and at what levels ? <P> They produce noise when the user blows air into the reed , which causes air within the resonator to vibrate . Traditionally , woodwinds were made of wood , but today , these musical devices can be made from plastic or metal as well . Despite their construction , woodwinds are simplistic in nature and brought to life through seasoned musicians who have an appreciation for these instruments . Types of Woodwind Instruments Flutes \u2013 There are two types of flutes : open and closed . Open flutes are generally made from high - grade metal alloys that contain nickel , silver and copper . They require that the player places their lips on the reed of the flute to deliver the air . Examples of open flutes include transverse flutes and end - blown flutes . Closed flutes have a channel that forms and directs the air stream over the edge . <P> Initially , it was developed to have a deep brass sound , but after Adolphe \u2019s patient ran out other people changed it \u2019s tone so it could be heard over the trumpets and trombones . Description : The soprano sax , alto sax , tenor sax , and baritone saxophone are the most common saxophones ; however , there are a few bass saxophones and a contra bass saxophones that can be found today . The soprano sax is pitched one octave higher than the tenor sax , and the alto sax is pitched one octave higher than the bari sax . Even though the saxophone is made out of brass , it is classified as a woodwind instrument because a single wooden reed is used to produce sound . The saxophone is still young when compared to other instruments . At less than 200 years old , this horn knows how to show of it \u2019s modern flair . There are many thing musicians can do to change the pitch by bending notes , growling , and using heavy vibrato ; many of these sounds can only be done on the sax . <P> Piccolo is about half the size of a regular flute ( 12 \u00c2\u00bd inches ) . Flute : The flute may be played in several types of groups and styles of music : orchestra , band , chamber ensembles - classical , jazz , blues , pop , rock , etc . Flutes may be made of wood , nickel , sterling silver , or silver . The type of metal used changes the overall tone and sound . Most flutes range from middle C to the second C above the treble clef . Blowing across the hole in the headjoint produces sound . Pitches are created by changing the combination of fingers on the keys , the player 's embouchure ( mouth position ) , and amount of air . <P> Various Notebook Pages for History or Characteristics The Eb clarinet plays a perfect fourth above the Bb clarinet . Clarinet : The clarinet is a single reed instrument . The best sounding clarinets are made of wood , but there are several plastic varieties . Keys on the instrument are made of metal . Pieces of the clarinet are the bell ( cone shape at the bottom ) , two main body pieces , mouthpiece , single wood reed , and a ligature that holds the reed on the mouthpiece . The Bb clarinet is the most widely used in orchestral and band settings . This clarinet 's ' C ' sounds like concert pitch ' Bb ' . <P> Soprano saxophone is a Bb transposing instrument . Alto Saxophone : The metal body of the saxophone is shaped into a cone ( conical shape ) . Most saxophones have a curved bell or end area that turns up and to the front . They are the only woodwind instruments made of brass . The single reed attached to the mouthpiece classifies it as a member of the woodwind family . Saxophones are considered woodwind instead of brass family because of the way it is blown into . Saxophones are not usually used in symphony orchestras , but instead are strong in jazz and rock bands . <P> Similar instruments have been found in ancient Sumeria / Ur . Europe had a loud outdoor reed instrument called the shawm around the 12th century that is thought to be the predecessor of the oboe . Oboe was the first common orchestral woodwind around the late 1600 's . The oboe is made of wood or plastic with metal keys . It does not have a mouthpiece , but has a double reed that the player places in the mouth . It looks similar to the clarinet . Sound is produced with vibrations from the double reed by blowing . <P> Brass Quintet : The versatility of the French horn is such that it can also be part of a brass quintet . French Horn and Saxophone : The French horn is so similar to woodwind instruments that it often shares parts with the alto saxophone in larger band settings . Both of these instruments , in fact , can be seen as a link between the brass and the woodwind family . French Horn and Flute : The flute is a woodwind often mistaken for brass because it is made out of metal , usually silver or gold . Unlike the French horn , though , the flute is a true woodwind and was originally made from roof , though it produces sound by air passing over an opening instead of vibrating a reed . Hand in Bell : Most French horn players support the horn by sticking their hand in the bell . According to McAnulty College 's School of Music , this also mutes the tone and gives the French horn the mellower , distant tone for blending with woodwinds . <P> : Regarding the Woodwinds Posted on August 2 , 2017 January 6 , 2018 by Canvas Shaped of Silence As someone who has only played string and keyboard instruments , I was very excited to explore and learn more about the woodwinds . Unlike some other instrument groups , the woodwind family is pretty diverse in many respects , with the instruments having a lot of differentiations in their registers , timbres and other qualities , resulting in very unique individual musical characteristics . As Adler points out , interestingly , even the word woodwinds itself does n\u2019t serve as the real unifier , since it does n\u2019t accurately describe the family anymore . This is because , although the majority of woodwinds used to be made of wood , the construction material has since changed for the modern instruments \u2013 especially the flutes , that are now generally made of metal . Next to that , as a newer invention , saxophones were n\u2019t created from the wood , but the brass instead . They are often classified as woodwinds because of the many properties and sounding mechanisms that they share with the other instruments from this group , however , there are older sources like Forsyth who have grouped them under the brass family . In fact , in many ways , the saxophone can be seen as a hybrid of the two . ( McNeil , 331 ) Again , because each woodwind instrument \u2019s nature is so individualized , each offered me a new , almost completely unique musical personality to explore . While I could already do this with the indefinite - pitched percussion , which are perhaps the most diverse group of instruments , to experiment in such way with a melodic instrument was quite a novelty for me . <P> Twice it has been in the National Championship Hammered Dulcimer contest held every September at Winfield , KS , and it has made it to the finals once . It sounds just great ! I take it for all the reasons listed above . It is durable , sounds wonderful , and most of the time when I get it out of the case , it is in tune . Designed to have a \" middle of the road \" sound . They are realtively low \" sustain \" , but with enough of that brightness to sound good like a hammered dulcimer should . They work equally well playing fast fiddle tunes , or slower hymns in church . <P> It does n\u2019t mean they wo n\u2019t play well it just means they are constructed differently . After all , there are high end [ used ] horns that wo n\u2019t play well if they were n\u2019t taken care of . Each year , thousands of children enter band class for the first time , so student instruments are mass produced and the manufactures get the materials in bulk at a discount . Also , most student models are constructed by machine where as a many professional models are custom - made . Most beginner level instruments are of high quality and you wo n\u2019t be compromising much in terms of sound quality and craftsmanship . If you consider how horns were classified several years ago , professional horns offered specs that come standard on many of today \u2019s student models including fancy lacquer and detailed engravings . However , student horns will often times use a lower grade of metal such as nickel instead of silver , and the keys may be set differently , like closed holes instead of open holes on a flute , to make it easier for the beginner . <P> Headjoint888365557007 ) Sku # 584001005901002 Sku 584001 Sankyo 584001 KCCC Professional Flutes URL_4 0 ( 0 Reviews ) Write a Review 45 day price guarantee , 45 day return policy , 100 % secure shopping MMGS7/584001000901000_MEDIA_SET true Buy New Buy Open Box Alerts Unavailable Item Note : This product has been discontinued but may be available as a Open Box item .

The recorder is end - blown , and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug , known as a block or fipple . <P> Playing an instrument like a flute also requires arranging one 's mouth in the right way , or it 's going to be impossible to get a sound out of it . Getting sounds out of any instrument at first is often the hardest part for anyone that 's going to start playing an instrument . It certainly looks easy from the outside , but plenty of people get discouraged almost immediately when it comes to playing musical instruments for the first time . Instruments will vary in terms of how easy it is to get a sound out of them , which is why some instruments are recommended for beginners and others are not . Playing that first note is very difficult for a lot of people , and plenty of people never even get past that particular stage . Getting a note out of a Native American Style flute is going to be easier than getting a note out of a trumpet , trombone , or similar type of horns . Native American Style flutes are woodwinds , and people that have n't had a problem playing other woodwinds will probably be able to transition to playing these types of flutes very quickly . <P> They also help focus sound production , affecting the tone quality in a way that is much more impactful than just allowing sound waves to escape . Click to return to anatomy chart WHAT ARE THE FINE TUNERS ? Fine tuners allow for more precise tuning of each string . Fine tuners are rare for string basses , because the innovation of machine heads for tuning has made them virtually unneccesary . However , they can be found for all or some of the strings on the tailpiece of the string bass , most commonly on the E string . However , some instruments have fine tuners installed for all four strings . The fine tuning is done by a small lever that is adjusted by a small thumb screw . <P> Other hardwoods are sometimes used on lower quality instruments and are blackened to look like ebony . The string bass fingerboard does not have frets like a guitar to delineate one pitch from another , so the player must have a strong ear and sense of pitch to play confidently in tune . Click to return to anatomy chart WHAT ARE THE MACHINE HEADS ? The machine heads are made of metal and are used to adjust the pitch of each string easily . The string bass is the only member of the traditional stringed instrument family to have metal machine tuners , which are necessary due to the remarkable force exerted by the string bass 's larger gauge strings .

These important pieces are made of both metal and nylon materials today , though traditionally they were crafted from twisted strips of animal intestine . The precise adjustment of the tail gut has a major effect on the sound quality and tone of the string bass , and it may require occassional adjustment when it is new .

Click to return to anatomy chart WHAT IS THE TAILPIECE ? <P> How to Choose Bassoon Woodwind instruments use vibrating air to produce many different musical sounds . Despite their name , they are not all made of wood . They may also be made from metal , bone and ivory . They look like long sticks , and players blow air into them to create sounds . The different shape and materials of each instrument help to create its unique sound . Some woodwind family members that play in the orchestra are the flute , the clarinet , the oboe , and the bassoon . <P> Give Today !

Today , they are made of wood , metal , plastic or some combination . They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes , with holes , an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top . You play them by blowing air through the mouthpiece ( that 's the \" wind \" in \" woodwind \" ) and opening or closing the holes with your fingers to change the pitch . Metal caps called keys cover the holes of most woodwind instruments . The mouthpieces for some woodwinds , including the clarinet , oboe and bassoon , use a thin piece of wood called a reed , which vibrates when you blow across it . The clarinet uses a single reed made of one piece of wood , while the oboe and bassoon use a double reed made of two pieces joined together . Just as with the stringed instruments , the smaller woodwinds play higher pitches while the longer and larger instruments play the lower notes . <P> There are n't any string sections as there are in classic orchestras , but there 's little difference between orchestra music and wind symphony orchestra music . Function Woodwinds in a wind symphony orchestra usually play the music that would be played by string instruments in a traditional orchestra . These instruments include the flute , piccolo , oboe , clarinet , English horn , bassoon and saxophone . Many are made of wood , and most have reeds in the mouthpiece that vibrate to make sound when the player blows into the instrument . Flutes and piccolos have a hole in the side of the instrument , which the player blows into to make sounds . Different notes are played by fingering keys that cover different holes . Features Brass instruments in a wind symphony orchestra include the trumpet , french horn , trombone , baritone and tuba . They are made of metal , and the player makes sound by pressing his lips against the mouthpiece and blowing . The rest of the instrument amplifies the sound as it comes out of the bell - shaped part on the other end . The musician plays the various notes by pushing valves or moving slides to different positions . Types Percussion instruments are any instruments not classified as brass or woodwinds . These include drums and other instruments that are hit with drumsticks or other devices . Wind symphony orchestras usually have a few timpani drums , which are large drums with rounded bottoms that are tuned to play certain pitches . Other drums are n't tuned to a specific pitch . <P> Some student Saxes have keywork created from Nickel - Silver , which is a good strategy for strength in a vulnerable area . Clarinets and Oboes Clarinet and Oboe bodies are typically made of ABS plastic for student instruments . This is a good strategy for bumps , and also against the maintenance habits and climate changes that students face . Intermediate and professional instruments are made of Grenadilla wood ( which is changing as Grenadilla edges towards the endangered list ) . Because they are made of wood they should be protected against cracking . In case a student does n't swab their instrument out after playing , the moisture can cause the wood to be expanded and crack . Likewise , bringing your instrument university on a cold day and playing it without and can come to room temperature will cause it to crack , or perhaps rupture . This is caused a pressure differential from the warm air column within the instrument , as opposed to the cold temperature outside of the instrument . <P> The method 's limitations were recognized by Sachs and Hornbostel : there are many instruments that have multiple vibration sources at different times during a performance , making them difficult to classify . The H - S system divides all musical instruments into five categories : idiophones , membranophones , chordophones , aerophones , and electrophones . Idiophones Idiophones are musical instruments in which a vibrating solid material is used to produce sound . Examples of solid materials used in such instruments are stone , wood , and metal . Idiophones are differentiated according to the method used to make it vibrate . Concussion \u2014 A pair of similar instruments are struck together or struck against each other to create sounds , such as cymbals and castanets Friction \u2014 Instruments that produce sound when rubbed . An example of these is musical glasses in which the musician rubs his moistened fingers on the rim of the glasses to produce sound . <P> Stamping \u2014 Instruments that produce sound when stamped on a hard surface , such as the shoes used by tap dancers or Irish clogs . Stamped \u2014 When sound is produced by the material itself that 's being stamped on . Membranophones Membranophones are musical instruments that use vibrating stretched membranes or skin to produce sound . Membranophones are classified according to the shape of the instrument . Kettle Drums \u2014 Also known as vessel drums , these are rounded at the bottom and may be tunable or non - tunable . The vibrating membrane is either laced , nailed , or glued to the body and the player uses his hands , a beater , or both to strike it . Tubular Drums \u2014 Are further classified into shapes including barrel , cylindrical , conical , double conical , goblet , hourglass and shallow . <P> The piano , dulcimer , and the clavichord are examples of chordophones that are struck . Aerophones Aerophones produce sound by vibrating a column of air . These are commonly known as wind instruments and there are four basic types . Brasswinds \u2014 Made of metal , particularly brass , these instruments create sound through the vibration of a player 's lips on the mouthpiece . The air that passes through the player 's lips goes to the air column of the instrument and thus creates sound . Examples : trombone , trumpet , tuba Woodwinds \u2014 These instruments were originally made only of wood but now other materials are used . On reed instruments like the saxophone and the clarinet , a thin material is placed on the mouthpiece so that when the player blows into it the air is forced to go to a reed and sets it to vibrate . <P> After you start out with one of these you can expand and try things such as baritone saxophone , bass clarinet , or piccolo , which is a smaller version of the flute . Flutes are the most common exception to general facts about woodwinds . They are very unique , but still have always been considered woodwinds . Flutes used to be made of wood ; however , now they are made of metal . Reeds , and keys are the easiest ways to identify an instrument as woodwind , brass instruments typically have valves or slides . All woodwinds have keys , small buttons pressed to change the pitch of the sound . These are what allows different notes to be played . <P> As well as the current day flute , the boehm flute . The final section was the tweinth centuary were the devolopment of the flute was simply acknolodged . The flute is a woodwind instrument because of the way a flute produces sound and the construction Flutes are the oldest and have highest pitch out of all woodwinds . Different from other woodwinds because it is usually made of metal or steel . Also because it is a reedless instrument . Many other woodwinds are the clarinet , basoons , oboes and saxaphones . Woodwinds are always held to the side when playing . <P> What is a Woodwind ? The woodwind section in an orchestra consists of flute , clarinet , oboe and bassoon . All these were originally made of wood , which gave the section its name . Nowadays , flutes are usually made of metal while clarinets and oboes may be made of plastic . Many other instruments besides these four are also considered to be woodwinds , including recorders , saxophones and even bagpipes . On the other hand , the didjeridoo and the alpenhorn are both wooden instruments that you blow into , but they are not woodwinds . They are considered to be ' brass ' instruments , because they work on the same principles as other brass instruments . <P> There are three ways of changing the pitch of the note produced . These are discussed in the next three sections . Tone Holes The effective length of the tube can be changed by opening holes on the side of the tube . Since most of the air will go out through the hole , it is as if the tube has been shortened , so the pitch rises . Almost all woodwind instruments use these ' tone holes ' . In some , they are covered by the finger tips . In others , a system of pads , levers and keys is used to cover the holes , and these are controlled by the fingers . <P> Click to return to anatomy chart WHAT IS THE TAIL GUT ? The tailgut holds the cello 's tailpiece to the endpin collar . The tailgut of a modern cello is threaded at either end and attached to the tailpiece with a small adjustment screw . These vital pieces are made of both metal and nylon materials today , though traditionally they were crafted from twisted strips of animal intestine . The precise adjustment of the tail gut has a major effect on the sound quality and tone of the cello , and it may require occasional adjustment when it is new . Over time , the cello 's tail gut will settle and not need as much attention . Click to return to anatomy chart WHAT IS THE TAILPIECE ? <P> Each musical instrument has its own timbre ( tone color ) , as well as its own musically expressive dynamic resources and range . The quality of sound depends on the relationship between the shape of an instrument and the materials from which it is made . Various devices , such as mutes , and various techniques ( for example , on stringed instruments , pizzicato and the harmonic , or flageolet tone ) can alter the sound of an instrument . Musical instruments are usually classified as folk and professional instruments . Folk instruments may be unique ( found among a single people ) or \u201c international\u201d\u2014that is , widely used by various peoples with ethnic or long - standing historical and cultural ties . Thus , for example , the bandura is found only in the Ukraine , and the panduri and chonguri only in Georgia . But the gusli ( psaltery ) , sopel \u2019 , zhaleika , and volynka are used by Russians , Ukrainians , and Byelorussians . <P> Among them the system developed at the beginning of the 20th century by the Austrian musicologist E. von Hornbostel and the German musicologist C. Sachs has won recognition . ( The foundation for this system was laid in the second half of the 19th century by the Belgian musicologists F. Gevaert and V .- C. Mahillon . ) The Hornbostel - Sachs system rests on two criteria : the source of an instrument \u2019s sound and the means for producing it . According to the first criterion , instruments are classified as self - sounding ( idiophones or autophones ) , membranous ( membranophones ) , stringed ( chordophones ) , or wind instruments ( aerophones ) . The source of sound of the idiophones is the material from which the instrument or its sound - producing component is made ; of the membranophones , a stretched elastic skin ; of the chordophones , a stretched string ; and of the aerophones , the column of air enclosed in the canal of the pipe ( tubes ) . Depending on the means by which sound is produced , the idiophones are divided into plucked ( music box ) , friction , or rubbed ( kraatspill , nail violin , and glass harmonica ) , and struck , or hammered , instruments ( xylophone , cymbals , and castanets ) . The membranophones are classified as friction ( bugai ) and struck instruments ( bass and snare drums , and kettledrum ) , and the chordophones as plucked ( balalaika , harp , and guitar ) , bowed ( kemancha , violin ) , and hammered ( cimbalom ) . The wind instruments are classified as flued ( all flutes ) , reed ( zurna , oboe , clarinet , and bassoon ) , and mouthpiece instruments ( trumpets and horns ) . Instruments are subdivided further according to peculiarities in their construction . Thus , for example , flutes are classified as vertical ( open and stopped ) , transverse , and whistle flutes , and stringed keyboard instruments as plucked instruments ( spinet , harpsichord ) and hammered instruments ( pianoforte , clavichord ) . Electric instruments make up a special group among contemporary musical instruments . <P> They offer more professional specs while staying budget friendly . Specs A handmade headjoint is one of the features that sets apart intermediate from beginner flutes . Beginner flutes are almost always factory made . The bodies of most intermediate flutes are also factory made . Intermediate flutes will have a handmade headjoint , though . Another feature seen on many intermediate flutes , at least in the United States , is open holes . Open holes , while not necessary , allow the player to start learning certain extended techniques , like quarter tones . <P> Different materials can also affect the price of a piccolo . This post will give an overview to the different piccolo materials you can choose from . When choosing a piccolo , you can choose from a variety of materials . The most common are metal , plastic , and wood . Plastic is the cheapest , followed by metal , and wood is more expensive . There are also two types of plastic : straight plastic and composite . In this post , we are going to explore the many piccolo materials . We will also look at the pros and cons of each . Plastic Plastic piccolos are one of the most common , especially for students . They are cheap , resistant to extreme temperatures , and they work well for beginners . Some piccolos are made with both a plastic body and headjoint . Others have a plastic body and a metal headjoint . The pros of a plastic piccolo include the lower price as well as the durability of the piccolo . If you will be playing outside , plastic piccolos can withstand the heat and cold . You do n\u2019t have to worry about cracking , like with a wood piccolo . <P> Common brands : Pearl , Guo , Di Zhao , Roy Seaman Price range ( new ) : $ 800 - 1100 Price range ( used ) : $ 650 - 900 Metal Metal piccolos are probably the least common , but they do exist . They serve their own purpose for piccolo players . Metal piccolos , like flutes , come in different metals . You can find metal piccolos that are silver plated , solid silver , and even gold . Metal piccolos , while uncommon , are great for marching band and other outdoor events . Metal piccolos carry more than plastic or wood , so they can be heard on a large football field . My first piccolo was silver plated , and it was a great first instrument . I was able to use it in marching band , and it was also very affordable . Metal piccolos do cost a bit more than plastic piccolos , but not by much . Used metal piccolos are a much better deal than new , because they are not in high demand . If you plan to play outside a lot , metal piccolos are worth looking into . Common brands : Gemeinhardt , Armstrong Price range ( new ) : $ 1100 - 2700 Price range ( used ) : $ 250 - 1000 Wood Professional piccolos are almost always made of wood . You can even choose from different woods . Grenadilla is the most common wood , and you can find many companies that use the wood in their piccolos . <P> I only know that when I am playing a wooden flute , I feel connected to something that I do n't feel connected to when I ' m not playing one . I was not a great flute player in the beginning myself , but I started to try and build those fascinating instruments . My flute journal starts sometime around July 1981 . That 's when my first flutes were made . I never apprenticed with anybody and had no money or tools . Instead I had a family and two kids to support . I found a lathe in a friend 's basement and borrowed it . <P> Most beginner and intermediate model saxophones come with mouthpieces included , while many professional models will leave mouthpiece selection in the hands of the performer . Reeds When it comes to sound production , the reed is the very heart of the saxophone . Reed type and material vary widely and are subject to a great degree of personal preference in more experienced players . Giant cane is the most common and traditional material used in their production , however they can be coated in or made entirely out of synthetic materials as well , and each with a unique sound . Reeds also come in a range of \u201c hardness , \u201d measured on a scale from 1 to 5 ; the lower the number , the softer the reed . While a professional player may prefer harder reeds for the quality of sound they produce , beginner players will typically benefit from starting at lighter strengths . Ligatures and Caps The ligature holds the reed to the mouthpiece . The type and material can have an impact on the functioning of the reed , in addition to the player \u2019s personal preference . There is a wide variety of material used in their construction including all metal , leather / metal combinations , carbon fiber , and synthetic materials . Caps are used to cover the mouthpiece , ligature and the attached reed to protect them from damage . They are typically made of impact resistant plastic . As with mouthpieces , these items are typically included with beginner and intermediate models , though it may be left to the player \u2019s discretion for the professional models . Necks As shown in the image above , the neck sits between the mouthpiece and the main body of the saxophone . All saxophones come with a neck at the time of purchase . <P> Nov 16 2015 New Selmer S80 Mouthpiece Engraving Stamp mouthpiece , Uncategorized engraving , logo , mouthpiece , mpc , new , paris , s80 , s90 , Selmer , soloist , stamp Leave a comment I \u2019 ve been getting a lot of questions about Selmer mouthpieces looking different .

The flute can be played as part of an orchestra , band , or enjoyed on its own . It is also the oldest known musical instrument . For years flutes were made of wood , but during the last century , metal flutes became popular . However , the wooden flute has recently been winning new fans . The tube is made of a heavy wood known as grenadilla , while other components such as the key posts and the keys are made of silver . The warm timbre that is produced possesses great charm . Flutes are always woodwinds , even when they are made of metals , because that is what they are classified as - woodwind instruments - within the conventional system of classification of musical instruments . Woodwind instruments fall under one of two sub - classifications : flutes , and reed instruments . The flute family can be divided into two subfamilies : open flutes , and closed flutes . An open flute requires the player to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream . <P> In 14-carat gold , gold , silver , and copper are blended together , and higher levels of copper give the metal a reddish hue , while higher levels of silver produce a yellowish gold . In a concert hall , red 14-carat gold really sparkles like gold . As a musical instrument , it is important that a flute 's sound be beautiful , but for aesthetic purposes , the design and the material also need to be beautiful . Other metal flutes can be made with platinum , which weighs more than gold . These instruments produce a correspondingly stronger sound and are highly spectacular , as they seem to fill every corner of the concert hall with sound . Flautists who are used to playing a silver flute normally lack the strength to get the full sound out of a 14-carat gold , ( weighs 500 gms ) 18-carat gold , or platinum flute , as , surprisingly , flutes of different materials each have their own corresponding playing methods . Some flutes have an extra key at the end , and that instrument is called the B foot flute , because the player can get down one more note in the range . It is slightly longer and is sought after by advanced players . As I have mentioned the range of the flute , here it is for you . The range of the flute is from Middle C and upwards for three octaves . Most flutes can only reach middle C as their lowest note , but with that B foot flute , ( only available on metal flutes ) , they can get one note lower , namely the B The high C is normally available to all flautists , but to reach that octave higher up to that third C , requires skillful use of breath and tonguing , to achieve a clear steady sound , which not all flautists can do . The flautist can place their fingers for playing Middle C ( their lowest note , and then purely by breath control produce all the harmonics ( namely E , G , octave C , etc ) repeat them all the way up through the three octaves . Peter Logged Peter Anderson Administrator Sr . <P> These waves then bounce back and try to force the air in the vicinity of the embouchure hole back out through the embouchure hole . As this happens , the sound pressure in this section of the instrument falls , and air is sucked back in . Waves are then produced that cause the air around the edge of the embouchure hole to vibrate up and down , producing changes in the sound . You may wonder why metal flutes have a lip plate . The reason is simply to create the same thickness that a wooden flute has . What happens inside the head joint ? A reflective plate and natural cork are situated to the left of the embouchure hole . <P> of Instruments Inventory of Mouthpieces Product Serial Numbers Serial Numbers BLOG CONTACT Gemeinhardt 4S Piccolo $ 550.00 Here is a lovely Gemeinhardt 4S Piccolo \u2013 Solid Silver head and body , Conical Design .

Still in production , this is the upscale version of the basic Gemeinhardt piccolo While most metal piccolos are cylindrical , these Gemeinhardt 4S models are conical in design , as are almost all wood piccolos . The conical bore of the 4S is designed to mitigate the harshness or shrillness of cylindrical metal piccolos . Some of the old Haynes silver piccolos were conical . The conical picc \u2019s are more difficult to manufacture compared to a simple cylindrical piccolo . <P> In December 1998 , my wife and I were on our honeymoon in Gatlinburg , Tennessee . As many people do , we were checking out all the shops up and down the main street in town . We stopped in The Silver Galleon , and right on the front counter was a large rack of flutes . Of course , I made a beeline over there and started checking them out . I picked one up and started playing \u2014 and it was loud and clear and magical . I tried another and another and another , and they all sounded a thousand times better than the flute I had been playing for years . I simply had to have one , and even though we were broke newlyweds , I was once again able to scrape together enough money to buy one . <P> Traditionally they were always made of wood , although some of them are now made of metal or plastic . In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument . Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes : The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments . The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves . The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra . It plays one octave higher than the flute . There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute . Flutes are still sometimes made of wood , but mostly they are metal . The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute . There is a larger version called the cor anglais ( which means : \u201c English horn \u201d ) . This is a double reeded instrument . <P> Almost all flutes can be played in fundamental , octave , tierce , quatre and cinque modes simply by blowing harder and making the air - stream move more quickly and at a more shallow angle . Flute players select their instrument 's resonant mode with embouchure and breath control , much as brass players do . Many believe that the timbre is also affected by the material from which the instrument is made . For instance , instruments made of wood are often believed to be less bright than metal instruments . Different metals are also thought to influence the tone . However , a study in which professional players were blindfolded could find no significant differences between instruments made from a variety of different metals.[5 ] In two different sets of blind listening , no instrument was correctly identified in a first listening , and in a second , only the silver instrument was identified by a significant fraction of the listeners . <P> Prior to this , the south Indian flute had only seven finger holes with the fingering standard was developed by Sharaba Shastri of the Palladam school , in the beginning of the 20th century . The quality of the sound from the flute depends on the specific bamboo used to make it , and it is supposed that the best bamboos are from the Nagarcoil area in South India . Dvoyanka ( Double Flute ) The dvoyanka is a double flute from the Balkans made of a single piece of wood , with six sound holes on one side . It is most frequently made of ash - wood , plum tree , pear tree , cornel or boxwood . The tune is played on the one pipe , which is accompanied by a flat tone on the other pipe . This kind of playing is similar by structure to music played on the kaval . It is also a favorite instrument of shepherds . <P> Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute , panpipes and shakuhachi.[4 ] Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses , reeds , and hollowed - out tree branches . Later , flutes were made of metals such as tin , copper , or bronze . Modern concert flutes are usually made of high - grade metal alloys , usually containing nickel , silver , copper , or gold.[5 ] To produce a sound with a closed flute , the player is required to blow air into a duct . This duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge . As with the open flutes , the air is then split ; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound . <P> 're gone Show off your instrument You ' ve got your instrument , now it 's time to show it off ( it will also remind you to practice ... ) ! find out more FREE UK DELIVERY * on orders over \u00a3 50 5 year warranty on items over \u00a3 150 join Normans Select for better prices & more Flutes Technical Specifications There are a huge number of different specification options for flutes .

Material In a nut shell , the denser the metal your flute is made of the warmer and richer the sound it will produce . Silver therefore - being dense , while less expensive than gold or platinum , gives a rich tone without being too expensive . Thus student instruments tend to be made of nickel silver which is silver plated . Moving up to intermediate flutes many models have solid metal head joints . <P> Cello music is most often written in either bass or tenor clef . The rich tones of this instrument give it a very soulful sound which compliments the harp and other string instruments making it one of our favorite pairings . WOODWINDS FLUTE The flute , while part of the woodwind family , is not a reed instrument . It is classified as being an aerophone . Sound emitted from the flute is the result of air flow across the opening on the flute .

The instrument of professionals is typically gold or even platinum plated . <P> The sound of a perfectly played flute is very ...

To play the flute you hold it sideways , set your lips as if you were about to whistle , and then blow across the air hole . Although the modern flute is made entirely of metal , the flute originally was fashioned from wood and is still considered a member of the woodwind family . Oboe The oboe has no mouthpiece ; instead the sound is produced by blowing through two reeds that are tied together . Most bands and orchestras include only one or two oboes , so the music written for them is often very melodic and soloistic . The oboe is more difficult than most other instruments for a beginner , however , so a student interested in oboe will usually start on clarinet or flute . <P> The sound is begun by a wooden reed which vibrates against the mouthpiece when a player blows air through the instrument . The clarinet is also generally the most versatile of the woodwinds , and is equally at home in either symphonic or jazz ensembles . Many clarinets are still crafted from wood , but modern student - level clarinets are made of plastic for economy and durability . Saxophone The saxophone is something of a hybrid instrument : its body is made of brass , but it is classified as a woodwind because it uses a reed to create the sound . The saxophone is larger and requires more air than any of the other members of the woodwind family , and it produces a sound of great volume and projection . As a result , only a few are necessary for a balanced band sound . Students wishing to play saxophone will often begin on clarinet or flute and then switch to sax later .",
  "answer": "Contrary to what the name suggests , the difference between woodwinds and brass instruments is about how the sound is produced rather than what material they are made of . By and large , brass instruments amplify or modify the sound produced by lips vibrating against each other , while woodwinds create their own sound when wind is directed through them . This can happen by vibrating a reed in the case of oboes or clarinets , or by vibrating the air column contained within a transverse flute or a recorder , which is why they are called woodwinds ."

When art - world stars come and go as quickly as rock stars and movie idols , critics and art professionals need to go beyond a concern for what 's ` hot , ' and focus on qualities basic to art itself August 31 , 1987 By Theodore F Wolff New York AS every New York art lover knows , Labor Day marks the end of summer and the beginning of another brand new gallery season . Of course , everything does n't happen at once . Most galleries wo n't open until mid - September , and a few will hold off until early October before mounting their first big show . Gradually , however , the art world will shake itself free of its summertime lethargy . Rumors will once again fill the air , and dramatic new things will be hinted at and eagerly awaited . <P> Ideas and attitudes also took longer to develop - and to diminish or disappear - than they do today . The sequence from discovery to critical acclaim to museum acceptance ( or back to oblivion ) , that may have taken from three to five years in the 1950s ( and considerably longer in earlier decades ) , is often completed now within a six - month period . ` ` Hot '' new art - world stars , as a result , come and go as quickly as most of today 's rock and movie stars . All this , of course , has little to do with artistic quality or creative integrity . And yet , it seems to reflect what an increasing number of people throughout the United States want to hear or read about . No matter where I go , for every person who asks me substantive questions about the art of the 1980s there are three or four who only want to know who 's ` ` in '' and who 's ` ` out , '' and what new trends are emerging . Could you pass a US citizenship test ? <P> The mundanity of events is way too clear , so much that it begins to beg for something more substantial to happen .

If things are controlled and happen gradually then the man in the street excepts and gets used to it and does not cause a fuss , if the the change is sudden he shits himself .

On to your question ... warnings of a negative thing 4 - 5 months in advance is unprecidented .

You heard all this menstrual cycle stuff during that infamous \u201c girls and boys to separate rooms \u201d class in the fifth grade ! However , a brief review of the typical phases of your menstrual cycle can help you feel more clear about just when you can conceive . Every New Beginning \u2026 \u2026 Comes from Some Other Beginning 's End The first day of your period is considered \u201c Day 1 \u201d of any new cycle . Your period beginning means that all the work of your last cycle is starting over . It 's your body 's sign that it 's time to \u201c try again . \u201d In the past you may have found yourself feeling relieved to see your period every month . It 's not quite so welcome a sight when you 're trying to conceive . <P> It \u2019s a hot topic that lasts for weeks until we get involved with the daily grind of work , school and family . Rightfully so , these are all important responsibilities but , what happened to our New Year \u2019s resolution to get in the gym ? Well , like many \" bugs \" it came and went . Why does this happen ? Well simply because resolutions do n't work . Just like dieting , it \u2019s a temporary fix . If we commit to a temporary solution then guess what , the problem is going to come back . <P> Fitness does n't happen overnight , it does n't happen in a week and sometimes it does n't even happen in a month . It \u2019s a difficult journey ; you \u2019ll want to skip a workout day , treat yourself to a dessert or take a second serving of food , which can set us back from our goals . But the more we adopt to these changes gradually over time we will become more fit without even realizing it . That \u2019s why becoming fit has to be a lifestyle change , we have to gradually change our eating habits and gradually change our lack of mobility . It \u2019s like starting a new job where in the beginning can be a challenge to adjust , but then you \u2019ll eventually adapt and learn how things operate . Work is part of our lifestyle , and fitness should be too . You see the reason why the gyms are packed the first couple of weeks of the year is because there are so many enthusiastic folks who are making a short term change , they have n\u2019t committed to taking the lifestyle journey . <P> As for my favorite band , the reunion would fail , because the band members have been strong egos , which , if put together could never find a real chemistry : no management so far was able to create peace within them and maybe their early producers in the 80 \u2019s managed to share some human touch to them . As opposite , a reunion designed for a farewell tour is a more possible thing to happen : all tensions would end , because everyone would think it is the last time on Earth they would meet with each other and us fans we could enjoy really terrific moments with all involved in on the stage ! The farewell tours are maybe the most expensive ones to plan and to realize for the record companies and insurance companies and it is a business . For us fans , it would actually be the beginning of a long period of tears , due to the end of whoever artist \u2019s career . I did n\u2019t realize that , considering all of the above aspects , celebrating a milestone year in long time artistic careers is just a huge challenge . Do not to underestimate it .

Whatever manifests is just one of many possible states , but many other states may still coexist alongside the manifested one . <P> There is power there ! The power to change the future , and to make the present a much pleasanter place . Even if you are not an old soul \u2013 and it makes no difference to the planet , or human consciousness \u2013 you can use the power of co - creation to choose the brightest possible outcome for humanity and the planet .

Tell us what subjects most interest you ! <P> An Interview Artistic Research Encounters / We ARE research Donnerstag , 25 . April 2013 Boris Groys on Art . An Interview Lily F\u00fcrstenow - Khositashvili : How would you characterise critical tendencies in contemporary artistic discourse , what role does the critical aspect play as far as artistic value is concerned ? Boris Groys : Malevich wrote that an artist should never do what he / she likes . <P> The artists of the movement were as good or as bad as any others . Yet we value them not for their merit but for their attitude , because they stood for their ideas , or claimed they had ideas . But , of course , all these attitudes have to be critically analysed . LFK : What about the issue of artistic merit ? Could one still go as far as defining certain criteria of quality ? BG : Art is interesting in so far as it is a symptom of the processes that take place in peoples minds , in peoples hearts , as a symptom of the socio - economic and political relations . This is the essential aspect of artistic value if at all . <P> The problem of avant - garde is that it aimed not at the description of life but at the transformation , reorganisation of life . And it coincided with the historical moment of revolution . The moment when the old system was destroyed and there was the feeling of something on the rise . That was the moment of the new beginning that the post - Soviet space does n't experience . On the contrary , it is defined by the return to the past . The fall of the Soviet Union brought about the establishment of the reactionary and conservative social structures . The return to capitalism , to nationalism , the return to the 19th century in fact . <P> to tame an animal transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement , allowing the ability to support an increasingly large population A sudden , extreme or complete to change ( as a manner of living and working a sudden or ex ream , complete change in living and working PASTORAL ( it would n't let me add the picture ) of or relating to the countryside or to the lives of people who live in the country transition of many human cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement , allowing the ability to support an increasingly large population Fill Fit Remove Media T Add text T Remove text NomadMAD A person who travels from place to place , in search of to breed or train an animal to need and accept the care of human beings ; to tame an animal to breed or train an animal to need and accept the care of human beings ; to tame an animal A sudden change domesticacation domestication of animals neolethic period the beginning of farming Variable A symbol for a number we do n't know yet .

In fact , in this sense , it is the very opposite of real progress . The beginning date of the Kali Yuga is interesting because it appears to coincide roughly with the start of recorded history . Thus all that we regard as our known past falls within the period of spiritual ignorance , the lowest point in the cycle that runs from a pristine new beginning when men walk with the gods to the time when the gods withdraw , spirit is gradually obscured and our external physical environment becomes the principal focus of attention . Now this may be a fall in one sense , it undoubtedly is a fall , but it is also a natural and inevitable occurrence that presumably has the purpose or effect of helping us develop aspects of our nature ( primarily mental ) that otherwise might remain in abeyance . How far it is taken , though , probably depends on us and our reaction to the cosmic winds of change . We can go completely with the flow of spiritual deterioration or we can recognise it for what it is and , to an extent at least , remain apart from it , remaining centred , insofar as possible , in higher truth . <P> Roughly 70 % of these tokens will be sold at 1 mBTC/ JDC , attracting at least 700 BTC for further service development .

Click to expand ... Yes , John , that 's exactly what it means . LF-5 begins at 5Hz and remains at 5Hz all the way until it ends . It does not begin at a higher frequency and descend down until reaching 5Hz , nor does it climb back up to a higher frequency at the end of the track . <P> never a fixed frequency for it to get a handle on ? Everything I ' ve been able to read about entrainment suggests that entrainment only occurs if the brain has a fixed frequency to lock onto . Going back to the example Michael gave about that 17th century Dutch scientist ( I forget his name ) who discovered the phenomenon of entrainment by starting the pendulums of clocks swinging at different times , then came back later to find they had all synchronized and were swinging in unison , none of those clocks started at one rate and then sped up or slowed over a gradual period of time to give the other clocks a chance to gradually match them . They started off at one rate and they all ended up matching that exact same rate . To my mind that suggests that easing your way into entrainment or back out of entrainment is simply not necessary . You pick the target frequency and the brain zeros in on it . As for those entrainment tracks that use the wind up and wind down strategy , since they never give the brain a fixed entrainment wave to lock on to during those \" winding \" periods , that time would seem to be completely wasted . Your brain does n't really begin entraining with them until they hit and hold at their target frequency . I ' m guessing that 's one of the reasons I ' ve found the LifeFlow tracks to be so much more effective . They do n't waste any time either at their beginning or end . They just immerse me immediately at the frequency I want to go to . As for gradually coming out , I know that for example , when I ' m daydreaming , I ' m in a state of predominantly Alpha waves . If something comes up and I need to return to full , normal Beta consciousness , I do n't need something to gradually bring me out of the daydream over a 10 or 15 minute period . My brain just goes from Alpha to Beta immediately , and I ' m right there where I need to be . So those wind up / down periods really do seem to be nothing but wasted filler time on most entrainment tracks . If I have a 30 minute track , and 10 minutes at the beginning is used to wind down from Beta to Alpha or another target frequency , and another 10 minutes is taken at the end of the track to go from the target frequency back up to Beta , that means 20 minutes of my 30 minute track were completely wasted . <P> This option requires that you manually start the second phase . For more information , see Move to the next phase . Note This option is n't available for phased deployments of applications . Gradually make this software available over this period of time ( in days ) Starting in version 1806 , configure this setting for the rollout in each phase to happen gradually . This behavior helps mitigate the risk of deployment issues , and decreases the load on the network that is caused by the distribution of content to clients . The site gradually makes the software available depending on the configuration for each phase . Every client in a phase has a deadline relative to the time the software is made available . <P> duration . 0:03 The speed can accelerate and 0:05 decelerate rapidly or slowly , all based on a timing function we set . 0:10 Timing functions are often called easing functions . 0:13 Because they gradually set the pace of a transition 0:16 to produce a more realistic transition effect . 0:19 You see , real life objects do n't always move at a constant speed , and 0:24 they do n't just start and stop abruptly . 0:27 So , with CSS timing functions , the browser can mimic real life motion . 0:32 For instance , the CSS transitions in this example look lively and interesting . <P> 5:39 So now the icon transition starts gradually . 5:43 And stops suddenly . 5:45 Let 's do one more , let 's try ease in out . 5:52 And as you can see it starts and stops gradually . 5:57 So I like ease out so I 'll go ahead and set the timing function 6:02 value to ease out and you can use whichever one you like best . 6:10 Like the other transition properties we can specify a comma separated list of 6:14 values for transition timing functions . 6:17 And each timing function value will be applied 6:20 to the corresponding properties listed in transition property . <P> When I zoom in , the aperture changes to f2 and then to f2.4 . When I zoom out , the aperture changes back to f1.6 . From what I can tell , the light level is not changing . If I set my aperture to f11 , when I zoom in and out the aperture does not change . This leads me to believe that the physical aperture is not changing . Only the ratio is changing to reflect what my f stop is for my focal length . Back to the question of the thread . <P> It 's obvious in some lenses that when zooming the lens gets longer and shorter , and so it would seem obvious that there could be a change in the amount of light transmitted . It is n't so obvious or intuitive when the lens does n't extend when zooming , but the effect is the same . It is n't intuitive that changing the f number changes the size of the image - yet this happens . It is n't intuitive that changing the f number can change the point of focus , yet this can happen . It is n't intuitive that our planet rotates on its own axis and simultaneously around the sun -- all common sense says the opposite -- yet this is what happens . Sometimes , common sense and intuition are wrong .

Search Start a new topic Discussions Chargebee Forums Questions Charge at the end of subscription O Onelyst started a topic over 2 years ago Hi , I am surprised there is n't an option to charge at the end of the term . I have worked with various workarounds , but none of them are neat enough to allow using all the functionality chargebee has to offer . When does this feature happen ? 1 person has this question 9 Comments Oldest First Popular Newest First Sorted by Oldest First Anand said over 2 years ago Hello , Many thanks for reaching out to us ! Quick Question : Are you looking to add an additional charge for the subscription at the end of current term ? If so , you could make use of the following APIs : 1 } Add charge at term end 2 } Charge addon at term end Please let us know if you need any clarification . <P> In that case , as a workaround , you could configure a plan with one month trial period , thereby allowing you to collect the payments only during the end of term . Let me elucidate with an example below : When customers sign up for the plan with one month trial , they will be not be charged anything upfront . The payment for the current term will only be charged when trial gets exhausted and subscription turns active after a month { in other words - end of current term} If suppose , you 'd like to include an addon to the subscription , you could do that and set the change to happen on next renewal , such that it is collected along the plan amount at term end . Will this work ? Please let us know . G George Chailazopoulos said over 2 years ago Hey , I am facing the same issue with Onelyst . I need the subscription to be charged at the end of every month . How is your workaround going to solve this issue ? With a trial period is n't it going to be solved only for first month and still the term end will not be the end of the month . Anand said over 2 years ago Hey George , Thanks for your reply . Configuring a 30 day trial would restrict the system from collecting subscription payment immediately when the customer signs up . For example , if the customers sign up on May 1st , they will not be charged anything upfront and their next billing date would be May 31st { where the month 's payment would be collected} <P> Full charges will be collected on 7/1 On 8/1 , a consolidated invoice will be generated for subscriptions 1 and 2 . 1 person likes this Login or Signup to post a comment More topics in Questions EU VAT Support ?

It came and went without much of a whimper because of adequate planning and analysis of the situation . Impressive movie special effects aside , Dec. 21 , 2012 , wo n't be the end of the world as we know . <P> Then these two fables were linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 -- hence the predicted doomsday date of December 21 , 2012 . Q : Does the Mayan calendar end in December 2012 ? A : Just as the calendar you have on your kitchen wall does not cease to exist after December 31 , the Mayan calendar does not cease to exist on December 21 , 2012 . This date is the end of the Mayan long - count period but then -- just as your calendar begins again on January 1 -- another long - count period begins for the Mayan calendar . Q : Could a phenomena occur where planets align in a way that impacts Earth ? A : There are no planetary alignments in the next few decades , Earth will not cross the galactic plane in 2012 , and even if these alignments were to occur , their effects on the Earth would be negligible . Each December the Earth and sun align with the approximate center of the Milky Way Galaxy but that is an annual event of no consequence . <P> How does this affect me ?

So we all have our bit to do to make politicians realise that these things are important . And we show that by our actions . That is fundamental to making change happen .

It 's what designers ' clients want , I imagine . <P> Look at how Tony Blair had to side with Bush over Iraq - I ' m sure he had no choice considering the history between the two countries . Maybe there would be a few less stupid decisions , possibly a few less wars . I do n't think it 'll change unless there 's pressure from the American people .

If a paradox does happen in the BTTF universe what will the end result be ? Will the universe actually explode ? Have you ever considered paradoxes did happen in BTTF but we never noticed it ? sn939 March 2012 edited March 2012 Tornreaper wrote : \u00bb Yeah in the final timeline Doc obviously got struck by lightning . <P> You must continue reading for quite a period of time until you get to the very last part : \u201c The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all . Amen . \u201d I view the end times signs in the exact same way . When the first concrete signs appear , we know the end has only initiated , and there will be an unknown period of time . When we see the very last sign , we know the end is here . God created each and every thing in the universe with a very rhythmic pattern , just like a giant clock . Isaac Newton ( one of the greatest scientists ) , viewed the entire universe as one giant clock . <P> Each new sign progresses the clock one step closer to its end . This continues to slowly progress , until the clock strikes the last point , and the end is here . Are We In the End Times Right Now ? How Can We Know ? In my personal opinion , we are in the first series of signs of the end times right now . Does that mean the end is near ? It means the beginning of the end is here , and the end times are going to come next . We have no idea how long of a period of time will pass as each sign is fulfilled . We can only speculate , and should never make specific / bold predictions , or state something as doctrine . Anyway , let \u2019s consider each of these signs of the end listed in the Bible one by one and relate them to events happening today , and see how many may have come to pass : 1 . <P> For this reason , I think it may still be a while , perhaps not even in my lifetime . The reason I say that is because there are still many \u201c signs \u201d that have yet to be fulfilled . I think the one world government is going to take a little more time to develop , although I am sometimes alarmed at the pace things seem to be happening . It will happen very gradually and each generation will be used to it . Plus , a lot more things will need to go online so the government will be able to totally track and control any aspect of your life ( they can almost do this already ) . I think technology will have to get to the point to where there is no cash , and everything is done electronically ( it almost is that way now ) . It would n\u2019t surprise me at all if it happened in my life time , or if it took 200 more years . <P> We have to remember that people have thought the world would end since Jesus Christ ascended to God \u2019s right hand . Even most of the disciples thought he may return in their lifetime , and that was roughly 2,000 years ago . So I know that many of the signs have been fulfilled , but not all of them . So in general I think we are in the \u201c beginning of the end times , \u201d and the end itself is rapidly approaching . Nevertheless , Jesus told us to \u201c watch \u201d and to always be ready for His return . \u201c Take heed , keep on the alert ; for you do not know when the appointed time will come . \u201c It is like a man away on a journey , who upon leaving his house and putting his slaves in charge , assigning to each one his task , also commanded the doorkeeper to stay on the alert . <P> \" I do not see why people think that the world is going to end on December 21,2012 !

These blocks are particularly appreciated in winter thanks to their most long - lasting time of conservation . Furthermore , we can not make it during all year . Indeed , we can propose them only during a certain period which extends of the beginning of October at the end of April because the heat of the summer can provoke a thermal shock which would split - even would break - the whole block exposed to strong heat . In the same way , a block of ice has to adapt itself to the ambient temperature before beginning to work it . The block is going to become covered generally at first with vapor ( condensation ) , and it is necessary to wait that this one disappears gradually before beginning to sculpture it to avoid any crack in the block . There 's not so long time of it , La Glaci\u00e8re took charge with sculpturing them with the direct help of an artist . But this one left and we tried hard for a long period to find a person having the same talents . In spite of all our efforts , we had n't found that person . Nevertheless , we can guide you to independent persons knowing how to work the ice in an artistic way . They can take charge with sculpturing the ice blocks directly at the place , allowing you like this to observe the evolution of their works .

Some fresh sculptural ideas formed in my mind but although I had previously done some stone carving I did n't pursue the activity further in any personal way . My interests were transforming slowly towards a more two - dimensional expression , making collages , combining pieces of cut or torn coloured paper and highlighting different areas with oil pastels . It was a medium I was gradually beginning to embrace . When I returned to England in the late summer of 1974 these little sticks of colour had in fact more or less completely replaced chisels and rasps as my essential expressive tools . Returning and rest Several factors seem to have been conspiring together to prompt my return to England . Various alternatives had presented themselves in terms of a fresh direction or the resolution to an indefinable longing for something beyond my immediate circumstances and expression , but I had responded with little conviction . <P> donny Should n't the Society chnage the name of its flagship publication to The Watchtower Apparently Announcing Jehovah 's Kingdom reslight2 Quote from Terry : Where Russell made his worst error was in his certainty . He foolishly ( because he was naive and honest ) made his theories TESTABLE as to falsifiability . In other words , he set himself up to prove whether or not he was a crackpot and a fool ! Armageddon was advertised as , \" not the beginning of the end , but , the end itself . \" 1914 was selected based on various ideas already worked out by other sincere crackpots . The main thing that Russell was expecting for 1914 was the ending of the Gentile Times and the beginning of the \" time of trouble . \" It is this aspect of his expectations that I will focus on in this post . <P> trouble shall be ushered in ; and that time of trouble we understand is the one the Scriptures tell about \u2013 a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation , a time of trouble which shall overwhelm all sorts of government , and every institution of the present time ; and a time of trouble which thus will make ready and prepare mankind for the glorious reign of Christ and his Church , for the blessing and uplifting of all the families of the earth . -- What Pastor Russell Said , Question 555:4 Russell again expresses his expectation of the the \" lease \" of Gentile rulership would end in 1914 . He mentions 1915 , the date the Edgars set forth by parallel as indicating the beginning of the blessings ; he also mentions 1920 , another date that was circulating amongst the Bible Students as a possible date for the end of the time of the trouble and the beginning of the blessings . Russell emphasizes 1914 as the beginning of the time of trouble , however , as he states , if his expectations were not realized , it would not overthrow his faith in the divine plan . 1910 Nineteen hundred and fourteen is the time when the \u201c Gentile Times \u201d will end .

In this section we are only going to use the tutorial entry exit system we developed earlier as the method for how we will show the risk and performance differences between fixed and risk rate sizing . To demonstrate fixed quantity we will use the Basic Money Manager and set the quantity parameter to 1 contract or share , and we will test the trading system from the beginning of 2000 to the current data download date . At the end of test Trading Blox will generate a graph profile of how the system performed : Basic Money Manager Fixed Order Size Graph During testing this custom graph created to show the static nature of how the order size of the Basic Money Manager consistently applies the same quantity regardless of how much growth appears in the equity profile graph : Basic Money Manager Fixed Order Size Graph Our first tutorial system does n't include a protective exit price as part of its trading logic . When no protective price is available to generate a position 's estimate of loss when trading , the software assumes the risk of loss is infinite and thus shows the Total Risk profiles as being 100 % when ever there is a position is active . <P> One consequence of this case was that some antievolutionists choose to use the term \" intelligent design \" instead of \" creationism . \" ] Classical Period , 900 - 290 BC Detailed Timeline of European History Classical Period ( 900 - 290 BC ) Beginning of Western Culture and Philosophy Go to European History Interactive Map Classical Period Europe Interactive Map BioInteractive Search Results Lectures How reasoning and evidence are used to understand human evolution .

You at first need to find out how to take artistic pictures and a heavy and complex set of photographic equipments may never be the best for the same .

Once you are fully knowledgeable about the angles and artistic taste involved with photography , you may upgrade to a more expensive set of photographic equipments . 2 . <P> Did the composer intend it for intellectual pondering ?

Alternatively , one could simply postulate that time does n't change immediately . Rather , time changes gradually , in a wave slowly propagating from the past to the present . This can be played for mystery very well , e.g. by having people 's memories gradually change . Some people may not notice , while others may figure it out . This would give a protagonist or antagonist enough time to realise what 's going on and also travel through time , and can also be foreshadowed very nicely . This technique is , for example , used in Back to the Future , where Marty 's family gradually fades from a photo he took in his present . <P> All data about changed ages is recorded ( so they might talk about he 47th version of the 92th century etc ) and only the inhabitants of Eternity remember all versions .

It would be very hard to find a place for him in the picture of Latvian art development as his entire creative life is synchronised with the artistic processes in Moscow at that time . \u201c Gustavs Klucis was never an imitator trying to emulate the existing artistic trends . He was always in the front ranks , sometimes even a few steps ahead of others , given his innovative thinking and interest in everything new . \u201d At this point , Iveta Derkusova reminds us that , unfortunately , the artist \u2019s life came to a very abrupt and tragic end \u2013 he was one of the many thousands of Latvians who lived in Moscow and were executed by firing squads according to the \u201c telephone directory \u201d principle . \u201c He was one of them , just as another popular artist , Aleksandrs Dr\u0113vi\u0146\u0161 ; they even died on the same day : the 26th of February , 1938 . <P> But at the start of the 1930s , Soviet leaders began to realise that avant - garde art was too free and radical , and that it had pushed aside a large number of artists who would be much easier for the people to understand . And that is when Socialist realism began . Gustavs Klucis , and a lot of other avant - garde artists , were in a very complex situation , they were being accused of formalism , their work was being denounced ... Eventually all that took a very dangerous turn , and attempts to \u201c break \u201d the artists began \u2026 Gustavs Klucis was being criticised for a lot of things , including the use of photography , which is why he was gradually going back to other artistic genres , including painting . In the latter half of the 1930s , he was no longer one of those artists who helped consolidate the Soviet Union \u2019s official policies . \u201c Even with all those archive materials , we still do not have full information about what actually happened . What we know is that everything had reached a boiling point in Russian art , but we can not know how artists felt during that period , how they survived by finding compromises between what they were doing and what they had to do so they could work in their profession and pursue their creative vision ... \u201d Iveta Derkusova explains . <P> \" It 's difficult to make a committed relationship work when you do n't desire them , \" she says .

When his prediction turned out to be bogus ( a moment known as \u201c the Great Disappointment \u201d ) , many disillusioned \u201c Millerites \u201d abandoned their faith . Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses taught that Jesus would begin His millennial reign in 1914 . When that did n\u2019t happen , they pointed to the outbreak of World War I and began teaching that this was the \u201c beginning of the end . \u201d A few years later they moved the date to 1925 . Nothing happened that year , but more than a generation later they circulated the prediction that the world would end in 1975 .

Applications are closing soon for Ens \u2026 URL_0 about 4 months ago Features In Conversation : Ken Mackenzie - Forbes AM On Jesus Christ Superstar , the four - week rehearsal period and being an arts facilitator . You are currently the Artistic Director of The Production Company , but before you came into this role you worked in a variety of artistic leadership positions : as an executive producer , a general manager and a director . Can you tell me about the start of your musical journey and how you came to find your place as an artistic leader ? I trained as a musician and studied music as part of my degree at Queensland University , and I realised at that time that I did n't have enough talent to make it as a professional musician , so I came around to the thought that I would like to be in a situation where I could facilitate or administer the creation of music and opera , at that stage . I was also in the Commonwealth Government , working in the Department of Trade at the time , and in the late 1960 's they established the Australia Council , so at the beginning of 1970 , they created a position for a Senior Music Officer , which was the first position for a music officer ever created . <P> A lot goes into that initial artistic planning . Timeframe wise , next year 's musicals have been on my mind for up to three years already ! The Production Company creates incredible performances on really short rehearsal timeframes - from nothing to everything in a matter of weeks ! How does it happen so fast and so effectively ? You know , that is never an obstacle . I credit the artists : you put out the challenge and they can meet it . They 're aware of the timeframe , so the artist would never come to that first rehearsal with no idea of what 's about to happen : they get sent all their music and parts before they start , and while it 's only two weeks in the rehearsal room and one week in the theatre , if you use that time very sensibly <P> Nations go bankrupt in the same way . Banking collapses occur in the same way . Currency crises strike in the same way . They all happen gradually \u2026 and then suddenly . Sometimes overnight . History is generous with examples of entire nations that have suffered this fate , from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 to Argentina \u2019s millennial financial crisis in 2001 . The warning signs are always there , even at the beginning .",
  "answer": "The exact beginning or end date of artistic periods that are taught in school are mostly arbitrary . Art historians usually try to use a major event or the creation of an art piece that features characteristics of the new period , or the death of a representative character . For example , the Baroque period is widely thought to start with the first representation of the first Baroque opera , l'Orfeo , in 1607 , and end with the death of its most famous composer , Johann Sebastian Bach , in 1750 . However , musical styles had actually started changing long before Bach passed away , and were already exhibiting features of what was to become known as the Classical period . In general these dates are mostly just a way to remember which period came after which and what decades they cover ."

R.J. Anderson on 22 June , 2008 at 7:11 AM # I loathe the stuff .

Celia on 22 June , 2008 at 10:25 AM # Like Carrie , I adore the smell of coffee \u2013 I love the part of the store where they have the grind your own beans and it smells so wonderfully wonderfully good . However , I ca n\u2019t drink it . I do n\u2019t even think I \u2019 ve tried in many years now , since I \u2019 m pretty sure that the only way I \u2019d be able to drink it would be by putting in so much milk and sugar I \u2019d be better off just having tea and saving the milk for something else . <P> Us coffee - haters are pretty oppressed , though .

Or add flavorings because they enhance the taste , not because the taste needs to be camouflaged . The reason for this difference is that the aromatics in coffee are n't fully released when the water is full of chlorine , limescale , and other trace minerals . <P> For a better experience , please try one of these browsers : Chrome \u203a Firefox \u203a Safari \u203a Internet Explorer \u203a Answers By Category \u2014 Hydration \u2014 Drinking Coffee Drink Know alot of people drinking beer daily , well I drink paldo aloe drinks daily same way Is It good or bad ?

Do not store your coffee in a container that is made of plastic or metal . These materials can change the way that coffee tastes .

As an aqueous solution of alcohol , acids , phenolic and flavour compounds , wine is a complex liquid undergoing constant changes .

How do you know when it will be best to drink ? Over time flavours , aromas , and colours change . Whether the wine will benefit from these changes will depend on many factors , chief of which is personal taste . <P> The short answer is that wine ages better in a barrel than it does in a bottle . Most wine drinkers are aware that red wine improves with age . While this might not always be the case , it is widely believed primarily because of our experience with French wine . Particularly the better French wines , those with vintage and appellation designation have long been sold with the understanding that they require additional bottle aging before they are as enjoyable as they can be . <P> The extended barrel aging also seems to affect histamine levels . We think ( we are still studying this ) this is because what histamines are produced combine with other elements in the wine that render them nonreactive . So , what \u2019s the real reason we age our wines longer in the barrel ? It makes better wine . It give you the consumer all the benefits of wine that is properly aged . Our fans do n\u2019t need a big cellar and a fat pocketbook . We are aging the wine for them , and in a better way than they can do it themselves . <P> - Chowhound Labor Day Recipes for a Labor Day Potluck Party 8 Reasons Sangria Should Be the Star of Your Labor Day Party Easy BBQ Baby Back Pork Ribs How to Grill for Dad on Father \u2019s Day and Beyond How to Grill Pizza for Labor Day Drunken Watermelon Pops See All Labor Day \u203a Back To School Sweepstakes : You Could Win * an Intelligent Ceramic Mug !

By Jason Horn | Published on Tuesday , April 17 , 2007 Edit What happens as wine ages ? And how do you know when it will be best to drink ? When wine sits in the barrel or the bottle , the flavors , aromas , and colors change . Not every wine will benefit from aging . <P> They have an astringent , somewhat bitter taste and make your mouth feel dry . But over time , tannins \u201c soften \u201d because they polymerize , or form long chains with each other . The tannin polymer molecules feel and taste less harsh , says Ken Fugelsang , a professor of enology at California State University \u2013 Fresno . As a wine ages , it also develops a stronger aroma . Before tannins chain up , they \u201c hold on \u201d to volatile aroma chemicals , keeping them from evaporating , says John Clews , vice president of vineyard and winery operations for Clos Du Val in Napa , California . Like cut apples , vino turns brown when it comes into contact with the air . As it sits in the barrel or in a bottle with a cork ( which is porous and lets a little air in ) , a new red wine , initially deep purple , turns reddish , then slightly orange , then dull brown . <P> 1 Reply One of the biggest questions with wine is How long to let the wine age ? There are some rules of thumb , or maybe they \u2019re more in the realm of urban legend . Such as drinking whites right away , and letting most red wines age for a couple of years , and letting Cabernet Sauvignon age for at least 10 years . What happens when wine ages ? From a technical perspective , a bit of oxygen sneaks in through the cork , and then CHEMISTRY happens . From a taste perspective , this can have the effect of softening some of the bolder , fruit flavors that are more typical of a younger wine . In the best cases , when this really works , softening the big fruit flavors allows more subtlety , more complexity to express itself in the wine . <P> It would be a wise idea to learn about the particular type of wine you plan to store to learn just how long that particular type will store . Bordeaux ages great , but not all wines fall into this category . TIP ! White wine does not have to be cool to taste good . Every white wine is not the same texture , so they may be better served at different temperatures . Try something new when you \u2019re out to eat . If you want to impress the people you are having diner with , it is best to choose a wine they will not recognize . <P> Wine is best enjoyed in a calm environment . Tasting wine in a noisy or disruptive environment wo n\u2019t allow you to appreciate everything the wine has to offer . Young white wines are your best choice . Chardonnay is a wine which ages well , though . There is no oak involved in creating whites . This is usually not the case for red wine .

What happens to Wine as it ages ? June 1 , 2017ByBenjamin Norris 3 Comments 0Blog The other day , I heard for perhaps the thousandth time in my life the following cliche : \u201c Oh , X is like fine wine \u2026 it gets better with age \u201d , where X usually refers to a person , self - conscious about the fact that none of us are getting any younger . This got me asking myself the following questions : does all fine wine improve with age ? Do any poor quality wines also improve with age ? Which wines \u2013 if any \u2013 are best drunk young and fresh , and the younger the better ? And most pertinently of all \u2013 what actually happens to wine as it ages ? There \u2019s no doubt about the fact that the very top of end of the wine world is typified by aged bottles . The great wine collections and cellars of the world feature some astonishingly old wines , and many of the big releases from the major chateaus of Bordeaux and similar wineries recommend cellaring their produce for decades . In this way , wine becomes a powerful and valuable investment , or even an heirloom ; destined to never be opened by the owner , and merely passed from collector to collector , gaining value and ( so we \u2019re told ) quality over the years . <P> There \u2019s a fine art to deciding which vintage is going to be best suited to cellaring , and collectors and investors keep their ears close to the ground each year to try and snap up future classics . Essentially , it comes down to the winery experts taking into consideration the climatic conditions of a particular vintage year , and understanding how that will affect the level of tannin and acid in the wine produced . The more acid and tannin , and the stronger the structure , the more suited the wine is to lengthy cellaring . So , there you have it \u2013 a brief guide to how wine ages , and what to expect from a well aged wine . What are your thoughts ? Do you prefer your wines fresh and young , or do you appreciate the luxury of a bottle which has benefited from a decade in the cellar ? Let us know in the comments below ! <P> Additional bottle aging will further lighten the color . The color will continue moving from light ruby to brick to orange . Depending on the wine , that process could take 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 or even 100 years . What happens to a wine as it ages . As wine ages , the tannins that helped the wine age begin to soften and slowly dissipate . This is because the tannins in the wine change with time . This change alters the molecular structure of the wine providing a mellow , soft and pleasurable experience to the taster , that is quite different than what was experienced in the wines youth . <P> But that requires a lot of patience and a place to cellar your wine to maturity . Take it from me , as someone how has been cellaring wine for close to 20 years , the wines from my cellar offer dramatically better tasting experiences than those from bottles purchased after years in the marketplace . My bottles are younger , fresher and offer a more complete , tasting experience . What happens when a wine is too old . It \u2019s important to remember , most wines are not meant to age . Wines are living , breathing things and they do not live forever . Wines meant to age gradually move from their youth to maturity and eventually , like all living things , die from old age . When a wine is past its prime , the color will take on brown or extremely bricky colors . The wine will not taste of fruit . You can experience tart , bitter or acidic flavors . The wine could smell of vinegar or other unpleasant aromas . When buying older vintages of wine , a physical examination can tell you much of what you need to know to assess the potential level of quality in the wine . <P> A lower fill could be fine , but why take the chance ? A fill level into the shoulder is fine for a wine that is 50 years old . This is natural . As a wine ages , the wine will continue to evaporate . Too much evaporation for its age is a potential sign of an unhealthy wine . The color of a wine is also a good indicator of a wines condition . There is an easy way to look at a wine in the bottle for a guide as to the wines health and drinkability based on its color . <P> Port , for example , lasts for a long time and changes do n\u2019t become apparent for many years . Factors that help a wine to age more slowly and , therefore , for a long time , include tannin , acidity , sugar , and alcohol . Wines that are high in any or all of these elements are better candidates for aging . A Matter of Taste How long should a wine be aged ? That depends on the taste of the drinker . Some people like wines fresh , with plenty of primary flavors , while others enjoy wines that some might find to be too old . If you \u2019re interested in older wine , try buying a bottle that \u2019s been cellared in advance . <P> \u201d Red wines , when young , can be dominated by flavors from fruits and especially tannins . What we want to happen is for the wines to balance out , so that all the flavors in the wine come into play when you \u2019re drinking it . Wines can also develop interesting flavor complexity as part of this process . And the way it happens is by the wine aging . Wine aging is the least specific and scientific part of the whole winemaking process . A winemaker often will state the aging potential of the wine when it is released , but at that time it \u2019s a complete guess . The winemaker has very little idea how his wine will taste after 10 years . <P> Even if you have tried a few and did not like them chances are that you have not had the one for you . This information is going to help you when it comes to the wine selection process . Pinot Grigio TIP ! What you like when it comes to wine is what is most important . Although many professional dispute over which wine is best , the only thing that matters is what you like . If you are serving seafood for dinner , it can be paired quite well with a Pinot Grigio . A Pinot Grigio enhances the flavor of many different types of food . <P> Age - ability How long should you wait to drink that bottle of wine ? The question is based in the adages of \u201c Wine gets better with age \u201d and tales of astounding vintages . The truth is that no one really knows exactly when the best time to drink a bottle of wine is . Partly , because it \u2019s a matter of preference , but mostly because what happens when wine ages in the bottle is still somewhat of a mystery . The little we do know about wine aging is humorously depicted on the chart on the back wine label above that probably was meant to be dead serious . The desire to age wine has n\u2019t actually been a big thing for wine drinkers for the bulk of the time humans have been making wine and consuming it . When humans first started making wine , it was consumed as soon as possible since we had n\u2019t come up with good methods to store and transport wine in . Even when we did figure out how to make heavy amphoras or light leather pouches we either did n\u2019t stray far from the amphora or could n\u2019t carry much wine in our leather canteens so we consumed as much as we could until it \u201c went bad \u201d . It was n\u2019t until wine makers began adding sulfur in addition to the sulfur that occurs naturally via fermentation that we were able to keep wines for any significant period of time . And what does it mean anyway when wine \u201c goes bad \u201d anyway ? In general , it means one of two things : 1 . ) It no longer smells like healthy wine or does n\u2019t have much of any smell or 2 . ) It is in the process of turning into vinegar . <P> To what extent and what types of effects are largely unknown at this point , but we do know that some tannins do in fact breakdown over time which could be one of the causes of why the tannins in an aged wine appear \u201c soft \u201d . The other aspect of an aged wine is that it tends to lose it \u2019s brighter fruit ( or lighter weight ) characteristics over time because of oxygen exposure . Eventually , the heavier fruit characteristics and earthy tones will go by way of oxygen exposure too , but how long that will take is highly variable and it \u2019s something you find out after the fact . Right now , answering the question of \u201c When will this wine taste best ? \u201d can only be answered retrospectively , despite the number of wine professionals that attempt to make predictions . However , wine professional estimates based on their collective experiences of tasting wines of different vintages is the best information we have to go on to answer the more general question that we should be asking : \u201c What \u2019s the maximum amount of time I should let this wine sit before I uncork it ? \u201d To answer that , I would tell you to drink the wine within a few years of buying it off the shelf . <P> Well , check how it falls into the aid - factors in the aging process . We need the acidity in wines for them to taste good and make us feel as if we wanted more , right ? However , as time passes acidity tends to fade away and the wine tastes flat . But what happens when a wine is high in acidity and consequently lower in pH ? It actually lasts longer as we can preserve it for a longer period of time and still taste great when we drink it of course ! So that means that a high acidity \u2013 low pH wine has greater aging potential ! Do you imagine what it would be like tasting a wine with low acidity \u2013 high pH after trying to age it ? It would definitely feel indifferent , to say the least . I wonder if any of these two was aged .. Alcohol So , alcohol is basically formed in wine during the fermentation process , when yeast turns the sugars of the grape juice into carbon dioxide and ethanol . Ethanol is alcohol . But how does alcohol help a wine age ? In fact , it does n\u2019t ! Let me give a bit more info on that . Have your tried tasting a dry wine high in alcohol content after some small period of aging time ? <P> But , to truly get the most out of wine , you need to do your research . In the following piece , you will be given advice to help ensure you know everything about wine , thus , improving your experience with it . Do not spend your money on full cases of wine if you are not sure you like it . It is best to purchase an experimental bottle , or even better , taste the wine before you purchase it . You should consider buying full cases of win if you know you will easily be able to serve it when you have company . Wine should be stored in a dark , cool location . One of the best places to help your wine remain fresh if you do not have a wine cellar is in a closet in your basement . <P> Surveying the store can help you avoid missing anything . Many people think that the only wines that are worth drinking have to cost an arm and a leg . While there are a lot of great wines out there that cost an awful lot of money , there are just as many good tasting wines that are much more moderately priced . In order to fully taste the wine , you have to be able to smell it . Make sure that your nose is as clear as possible prior to doing a tasting . Once you have the glass in your hand , lean your face down toward it so that your nose is partially in the glass . Make sure you smell using both the right and the left nostril . <P> It \u2019s true . That \u2019s how it ages , by breathing and sitting . And nothing is worse that highly fluctuating temperatures . This ages the wine quickly . And not in a good way . Just like when you leave a glass of wine out overnight , it becomes bitter when it oxidizes . Yes , wine needs to breathe , or to oxidize to mature , but it has to be done just right . <P> \u201c New wines , \u201d also known as \u201c young wines , \u201d are supposed to taste great right now , and letting them languish over the long term wo n\u2019t result in better flavor ; instead , it could quite possibly lead to something undrinkable . So how can you tell which vintages to place into wine storage and which bottle to drink tonight for dinner ? To make good decisions , it helps to understand the process of wine aging and the chemical reactions involved . What Happens as Wine Ages ? The winemaking process is basically about turning an organic food stuff \u2014 in this case , different grape varieties \u2014 into a shelf - stable drink that wo n\u2019t decay as quickly as the original fruit . Eventually all wines goes bad as bacteria work their magic and make it decay , as they do to every once - living thing . Yet this process is slowed way down by the acidity and alcohol ; in the meantime , the wine \u2019s flavors can change and develop \u2014 often , but not always , for the better . <P> This can boost the flavor of your food . There are other white wines that also go well with your seafood . Seafood and a good bottle of white wine make for a perfect classy meal . Store your wine the right way if you want it to taste good over time . You do not want your wine to be too hot or too cold ; it can hurt the flavor . Let the flavor continue to develop by storing wines at 50 to 55 degrees for the best results . Specialized wine fridges can be used , or wines can be kept in cool basement spaces . <P> Just place some butter in a saucepan with a bit of wine . Simmer the sauce while it thickens and evaporates a little of the alcohol content . Drizzle it over the beef . Your wine will taste better if it is served at the ideal temperature . Red wines should be served at 60 degrees Fahrenheit . A good starting point for your wine is at 58 degrees . White wines are best served at 47 degrees . <P> The Value Proposition The value proposition offered by VinoMatch is we are a taste driven versus a dollar driven marketing platform . Our patent pending sensory attribute communication platform is the bridge between casual wine drinkers and professionals of the wine industry . VinoMatch is the answer to a long awaited solution for the industry issue : How to communicate taste and aroma in simple to understand terms to a vast majority of consumers whom have no prior wine knowledge ( casual wine drinkers ) . Answering the all important question \u2026 \u201c How does it taste ? \u201d While the advantage to casual wine drinkers is obvious , this long awaited solution solves two issues suffered by wine industry professionals : How to successfully market to casual wine drinkers without breaking the bank How to gain the interest of the novice wine drinker to learn more about wine We understand most novice wine drinkers will not convert to wine connoisseurs , however VinoMatch believes by easily matching consumers with wines suited to their personal taste preferences these consumers will find wines they LOVE . When people love something , it will naturally cultivate their interest to want to learn more . <P> Even though it \u2019s a best - loved for special occasions , dinner parties , and often as a way to unwind at the end of a crazy week , you have to make sure with wine so it does n\u2019t spoil before you open the bottle . Unsure what sorts of things you should beware about ? Here are things to watch for so your wine will be as anticipated when you \u2019re ready to serve it . If the same thing happens to wine , it \u2019s a different story . This is why people purchase wine coolers and refrigerators to keep their wines at the correct temp , and it \u2019s the impetus behind portable wine coolers when you \u2019 ve made a purchase and want to keep it at an appropriate temp until you get home . Basically , if your wine gets hot , it \u2019s toast . When grapes are pressed , the juice can soak with the grape skins , and the length of time that the skins and juice marinate together determines the tannin of a wine . <P> Does It Go Bad ? \u2013 WineLadybird Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Wineladybird About Blog Reviews Best Wine Aerator \u2013 Review Of Top 3 Products Best Wine Coolers Review \u2013 Top Brands Reviews of the Best Wine Bottle Openers \u00dcllo Wine Purifier Review \u2013 Remove Sulfites From Your Wine Recipes 10 Homemade Wine Recipes You Should Try The Best Homemade Apple Wine Recipe From Fresh Apples Best Homemade Blackberry Wine Recipe Best Homemade Blueberry Wine Recipe Best Homemade Raspberry Wine Recipe Home \u00bb Blog \u00bb Does Red Wine Go Bad ? <P> Are you clueless about the difference between red and white wine , aside from color ?

It is America 's favorite wine , and restaurants often take advantage of its popularity by charging more than it 's really worth . Consider affordable and other great - tasting alternatives such as Gr\u00fcner - Veltliner or something less popular like Riesling . Always smell your wine before you taste it . One reason is that it could be spoiled , which can be easily identified by smelling it , which could save you from getting sick . Additionally , you can also learn a lot about the wine from its aroma , and if you stick with this habit you will begin to identify how over time . Visit a wine tasting festival next time one is held in your area . <P> Swirl your glass around and bring it to your nose in order to pick up every scent . It \u2019s important to understand that not all wines will age well over time . Check the shelf life of the particular wine to find out how long you can store it before the flavor is negatively affected . Bordeaux is a wine that often ages well . TIP !

Dozens of proprietary wine glasses and decanters have come our way , all with claims to make wine taste better than it should . At the Wine School , we have disproved all these contraptions , and in classes like [ link id=\u201d14823\u2033 text=\u201dSommelier Secrets \u201c ] we show how absurd their claims are . Sonic Decanter Photo Sonic Decanter Recently , a new wine gadget has popped up on Kickstarter . It \u2019s called the Sonic Decanter . As of this writing , it \u2019s met it \u2019s funding goal , and in fact has exceeded that goal by nearly 200 % . The popularity of this device has been spurred on by articles in Huffington Post , CNET , The Times , and Gizmodo . Most of the articles extolled the virtues of the device , saying it made wine taste better . Sadly , none of the journalists took a hard enough look at the creator \u2019s claims . How the Sonic Decanter Works The creators of the device claim that it uses sonochemistry to change the molecular structure of wine . In other words , the device shoots ultrasound waves into the wine to alter flavor compounds . <P> Wine Review Blog All of our reviews in one big searchable database .

Storing your wine in a place that is dark and cool , such as a basement or closet , can really help to ensure you get the maximum flavor from your wine . When you first get a glass of wine , look at its color . This will tell you all about what the wine will taste like . Aged white wine gets darker and stronger . Aged red wine actually fades in color . How the wine has been aged and which grapes were used will also affect the color . <P> \u201c Do n\u2019t put your wine rack on a window sill . \u201d A closet or basement is better . Keep it still . Wine does better when it \u2019s left alone , without a lot of movement . Vibration is typically not an issue unless you live on a train car , she said . And short - term bouts of jostling , as happens during shipping , are n\u2019t worrisome . But when that wine arrives , let it lie down undisturbed . <P> , they are all added because the wine through error on the wine maker \u2019s part or just the roll of the dice in this year \u2019s harvest , did n\u2019t meet expectations . This would be akin to patching a chip on the sculpture . There are laws preventing additions to wine that would change their very nature . When Is A Wine No Longer A Wine ? In the WIRED article , the cheap base wines were being manipulated in order to mimic certain popular wines . Sometimes it is simple blending of a bulk wine with a boutique wine , but other times it comes from severe manipulation in adding esters , acid , etc . where the result product is unrecognizable from the bulk wine it started from . <P> Now , some so called experts will tell you to add this wine to a festive holiday punch or cocktail , but if you \u2019re adding bad wine to these things , you \u2019re not making a good punch or cocktail are you ? At a minimum you have to add the other ingredients at a quantity that masks that bad wine taste which is kind of like throwing good money after bad . The problem does n\u2019t stop there either . What happens when you see the person again ? Yes , you can hope the topic never comes up again , but what if they ask you how you liked it ? Like a lost puppy , bad wine follows you .

You should know how to pull a peel labels from wine . <P> I know that \u2019s an ambiguous term but what I mean is that the wine tastes like it was made in the vineyard and not like it was genetically engineered or manipulated . That \u2019s a huge factor for me . Something we do n\u2019t discuss a lot but I try to use in my notes is texture . How does the wine feel in your mouth ? I think that we are so busy with the structure \u2014 the acid , alcohol and tannin \u2014 that mouthfeel gets left behind . When I \u2019 m tasting for the restaurant or for pleasure that \u2019s a big factor for me . It does n\u2019t have to be dense and plush but it \u2019s how the texture works with the fruit and the structure that \u2019s a key component for me . Tasting : Sight TG : In terms of looking at wine to evaluate it either for professional purposes for your list or the MS context what are you trying to do ? What are your goals when looking at a wine ? TP : For both it \u2019s making sure there \u2019s no intentional flocculation whether the wine is old or however filtration or cold stabilization fits into the picture . I think you \u2019re looking at the wine initially to try to get your feet underneath you in terms of where the wine might be , where it might come from and how it might taste . For the CMS tasting format I do n\u2019t spend a lot of time on sight . <P> Is it life size ? TP : Yes and yes . TG : Once you create that image , does it get filed in your head like the rest of the images ? What happens to it ? TP : They go back into the file . TG : What does the file itself look like ?

If you can , what happens to it ? TP : No , it \u2019s 2D because it \u2019s the grid to me which is a piece of paper that I had on my fridge with a magnet for three years . TG : So you have all these images out in front of you . Can they shift ? <P> TG : Once again I have to say that this is a very elegant system for tasting . So now I \u2019 m interested in how you calibrate structure . So taste the wine again and pick something about the structure , acidity for instance . How much acidity does the wine have ? TP : Moderate . TG : How do you know it \u2019s moderate and not moderate - plus ? For that matter , how do you know it \u2019s not high ? <P> With that I have n\u2019t tasted many of those wines that have more than medium - plus acid so I know that this is medium acid . TG : I agree with your call of medium acidity . But how do you know it \u2019s not medium - minus or medium - plus ? What happens if you taste the wine again and try to make it medium - plus ? TP : It \u2019s just medium . TG : How do you know ?

What Does it Taste Like ? 946 2 by Karl McElligott 10 months ago In Red Wine The name derives from the small town of Montepulciano in the south east area of Tuscany . Similar to other Tuscan wines , the main grape used in the production of the wine is Sangiovese .

Predominant flavors highlight stone fruit such a cherries , red berries combined with medium bodied to firmer tannins and high acidity make it a great wine to pair with food .

One of the concepts that is talked a lot about when it comes to wine , is the effect of \" ageing \" . If you ask the average person in the street they will most likely tell you that an \" old \" wine is better than a \" young \" wine . Is this true ? Is this always true ? What happens to a wine as it ages that makes it get better ? How do different approaches to ageing wines affect the wine itself ? These are the some of the questions that I was hoping to get into when I organised a wine tasting with my friends at Theatre of Wine recently . Our tasting session was guided by Ruby who started us off with a 2017 Nerleux Saumur Blanc ( Loire , France ) which is a classic example of a wine that is supposed to be drunk when it is young ; it had a slightly tropical , pineapple nose and a crunchy green apple bite to the taste . <P> Some wines such as sauvignon blanc should be served cold but a chardonnay or a pinot will taste better at room temperature . There are many types of wine , and not all should be aged . You will need to research the type of wine that you have and the longevity that it will stay useful , even in the best conditions . Bordeaux is one wine that ages well . TIP ! Get creative when purchasing wine . You can experience different regions by trying their wines . <P> The first thing to do in a wine tasting is to assess the way a wine looks . Does the wine look good for its age ? When a wine reaches its full potential , the first thing that you 'll notice is the color . As wine ages , the color becomes more intense . For instance , a young Pinot Grigio will have a lighter yellow , almost clear color . As it ages in the bottle , the color will develop into more of a warmer , golden color . When looking at the wine , you want to make sure the color looks right for the age . The technique takes a bit of practice . The more wine you taste wine , the better you will become at knowing what color a wine should be at each stage of the aging process . No worries about \" perfecting \" this technique , the fun is in the practice ! Swirl and Sniff Swirling and sniffing the wine is a very important technique in tasting wine . Not surprising since most of us know that when eating food , about 50 % of the taste comes from the smell that travels through your nose . <P> Guests will find this a perfect cap to their meal . TIP ! Think about what you like when shopping for wine . You might be told that one wine is better than the one you like by a professional wine taster , but that wo n\u2019t make it taste better . It is important to properly plan for your trip to a winery . Decide in advance how much money you want to spend , and be sure to have a sober driver lined up . Write down any questions that you have , and think through your taste preferences in advance . If you ca n\u2019t stand the taste of a certain wine , do n\u2019t drink it ! Certain establishments push certain brands , particularly if they are linked to a celebrity . It is not uncommon for the price of these bottles to be twenty times above wholesale . A costly glass does not equal a better wine . Choose wines that you enjoy and do n\u2019t worry about the critics . TIP ! If you are getting headaches after drinking wine , you may want to limit how often you partake in wine . <P> Invest in a wine cellar if you want to maximize the value and longevity of the wine that you purchase . If you have wine that is valuable and that you can not store in your kitchen , a wine cellar is a perfect solution . You can preserve the taste and aroma of a wine if you store it properly . Extreme temperatures change how a wine will taste . Let the flavor continue to develop by storing wines at 50 to 55 degrees for the best results . Use a refrigerator made for wine or have them stored inside your cool basement . TIP ! <P> I was pretty skeptical about this trick \u2014 it seemed too good to be true . But to our surprise , it worked way better than we ever thought possible . To put it plain and simple , blending your wine is basically decanting it quicker . The wine reacts with the air to do what aging does in terms of taste . Alex Frank / Spoon University I do n't know about you , but I 'll spend 90 seconds of my life blending my wine in order to save more than $ 20 . Do you think I 'll get weird looks if I ask for my wine blended at the bar ? Oh well , it 's worth a shot . <P> Trust your gut and your own particular taste when buying wine . For instance , if you have a friend who is into a specific type of wine , but you hate it with a passion , do n\u2019t just blindly accept your friend \u2019s recommendation . Pinot Grigio is a great wine to serve with a seafood dinner . This wine , in particular , makes the food taste even better . Besides Pinot Grigio , many other white wines taste good with seafood . White wine and seafood make for a great match . TIP ! <P> YOu should feel relaxed to get the full experience from the wine . Many people drink and use white wine when making seafood . This goes so well with seafood and makes it taste better . In addition , the food makes the wine taste better , too . White wine and seafood make an excellent pair . TIP ! As you taste wine , try to isolate each aroma and flavor . <P> Tips Start making your own wine Can I really make wine that tastes as good as the best commercial wines ?

One fact you should note about this wine is while many other wines tend to taste good with aging , the sauvignon blanc grape is known to taste best when it is young . The taste tends to not be as pronounced or delicious as the bottle ages so keep that in mind when you decide to make the wine or buy it . If the grape was grown in a cooler climate than you can expect the grape to produce flavors like grass , green bell pepper , and floral notes . In warmer climates the taste profile develops more so into a tropical fruit taste with notes of peaches , slight grapefruit , pineapple , and more . Wine experts often use the words \u201c crisp , elegant , and fresh \u201d when referring to the sauvignon wine grape so for sure this is a wine that you need to put on your list of wines to make or buy .",
  "answer": "When wine ages , a chemical reaction is occurring within the wine . This chemical reaction changes the flavor to make it taste better , and can also affect the color and how it feels inside your mouth . Not all wine tastes better with age , though . There is a specific compound in wine called tannin that has a big effect on what the wine is going to taste like after aging . Different wines have different amounts of these tannins , so not all wine will taste equally better after aging ."

  "question": "Why were the main predators in New Zealand large birds , compared to other places in the world ? --T-- ",
  "document": "Yet here it 's widely known that this bird 's endangerment would have a great impact , not only ecologically , but for it 's importance as historical figure for this country .

New Zealand Birds Online , URL_8 . \u201c Scientific American . \u201d Scientific American , URL_5 . Skunks . <P> With no snakes , no large reptiles and no land mammals apart from two small bats , birds filled all of the ecological niches occupied elsewhere by other animals . For this reason , New Zealand was home of the largest bird which ever lived , the moa , one species of which stood 11 feet tall and weighed up to 450 pounds , as well as the largest eagle to ever live , Haast 's eagle . The moa occupied the same niche as grazing animals like deer and antelopes , and Haast 's eagle was the apex predator , the equivalent of the big cats of Africa , Asia and the Americas . Because of the lack of predators , about a third of New Zealand birds were flightless . Naturally enough , all eleven species of moa were flightless , but so were many smaller forest birds like kiwis , wekas , takahes and dozens of others . The long isolation of New Zealand birds from other land masses resulted in many unique forms arising , like the kiwi , the only bird with nostrils at the end of its beak , and the world 's largest egg compared to the size of the bird ; the wrybill , the only bird whose beak bends sideways ; the kea , the world 's only alpine parrot , as happy in the snow and ice as in the forest ; and the flightless kakapo , which looks like an owl but is actually the world 's largest parrot , and has an unearthly deeply resonant booming song which can carry for five kilometers . Sadly , humans not only destroyed much of the native habitat , they also introduced mammalian predators into this paradise . The Polynesian voyagers called maori introduced Polynesian rats which preyed on the eggs and chicks of ground nesting birds , and the maori themselves exterminated the moa . <P> In 2015 Project Janszoon and DOC began releasing k\u0101k\u0101 into Abel Tasman National Park .

User Follow Facebook Facebook Twitter Twitter YouTube YouTube Tumblr Tumblr Instagram Instagram Home News Animals Birds on Islands Are Losing the Ability to Fly By Ed Yong 11 April 2016 Birds on Islands Are Losing the Ability to Fly Birds inhibiting islands around the world , including New Zealand , are evolving flightless qualities , here 's why . Follow Share Tweet Follow Share Comment Before the arrival of humans \u2014 and the rats , cats , and other predators that we brought \u2014 New Zealand was an idyllic haven for birds . Without ground - dwelling mammalian hunters to bother them , many of the local species lost the ability to fly . There \u2019s the kakapo , a giant , booming parrot with an owl - like countenance ; the takahe , weka , and other flightless relatives of coots and moorhens ; a couple of flightless ducks ; and , of course , the iconic kiwi . These birds are part of a pattern that plays out across the world \u2019s islands . Wherever predators are kept away by expanses of water , birds become flightless \u2014 quickly and repeatedly . This process has happened on more than a thousand independent occasions , producing the awkward dodo of Mauritius , the club - winged ibis of Jamaica , and the tatty - winged flightless cormorant of the Galapagos . New Zealand is home to the kiwi and more flightless birds than any other nation . Chris McLennan , Alamy The call of the ground is a strong one , and it exists even when the skies are still an option . Natalie Wright from the University of Montana demonstrated this by collecting data on 868 species . She showed that even when island birds can still fly , they \u2019re edging towards flightlessness . <P> today , mostly on small , protected island reserves nearby It Does What ? ! Strange things happen when you leave a few species alone on a distant island for a few million years . Places like New Zealand , Australia , Madagascar , and Hawaii are ( or were ) full of plants and animals that seem alien compared to rest - of - the - world standards . This is often due to a set of conditions and evolutionary challenges unlike those seen on the continent . Life on New Zealand is particularly interesting , having been heavily shaped by the fact that the only terrestrial mammals there are bats . Every animal that evolved there did so without the pressure of having to avoid toothy predators stalking them through the forest . <P> New Zealand is a land dominated by birds . Until humans began to arrive on our shores 700 odd years ago New Zealand 's only land mammals were small bats , so our native species evolved over millions of years without land mammals . Along with humans came a large assortment of animals - first rats and dogs and later our most damaging pests of all ; stoats and possums . Our native birds were used to predators such as the now extinct Haast 's eagle who would hunt via sight . <P> New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy under England and the Queen is the head of state . New Zealand governs itself through its \" Westminster \" parliamentary system and currently there are seven political parties presently represented in Parliament by 121 members of Parliament . The public votes every three years and the two main political parties are the National Party and the Labour Party . New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the vote in 1893 . The flag of New Zealand has been in its current form since 1902 . Due to New Zealand 's strong British ties at that time , the flag is the British Blue Ensign with four stars representing the Southern Cross . The Southern Cross constellation is one of the striking features of the southern hemisphere sky and the Southern Cross are the four brightest stars in the sky over New Zealand . <P> Sadly , many travellers have n't had the opportunity to actually meet the local people and explore the magic of the country . Many travellers choose to experience New Zealand by way of a large coach tour or alternatively , they have chosen to \" self - drive \" with a GPS . It was , for this reason , we guide and host our own intimate small group tours of New Zealand 's South Island . New Zealand - where nature comes to you ... The tragedy concerning the recent history of New Zealand 's flora , fauna , the birds , reptiles and insects is the damage caused by humans and the predators they brought with them . Before people arrived , New Zealand was a land of birds , an avian society and night and day the forests were alive with rustlings , calls , booms , whistles and hoots . Early explorers and European settlers noted that in particular , the New Zealand forest had a loud dawn chorus . This is no longer the case due to extensive loss of forests and the introduction of bird predators and competing species such as wasps . The bellbird and the tui are two of the birds that would have formed part of the dawn chorus since they have a vocal and melodious call . There were over 120 species of geese , ducks , rails , moa , parrots , owls , wrens and other perching birds . Around 70 of these were found only in New Zealand . Almost a quarter was nocturnal , and many were giants . The huge , flightless , foliage - browsing moa occupied niches usually the reserve of browsing mammals and the tiny wren scampered about on the ground like a mouse . Birds such as the weka , kea and k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d evolved in isolation and they had few natural predators apart from the giant Haast 's eagle , which swooped down on the very largest moa about 1,000 years ago . <P> On the other hand , it can be all too easy to jump to conclusions about perceptions of co - evolution and we often need to consider other possibilities : plants may grow tall , may grow weird or giant fruit , or may exhibit \u2018 defensive \u2019 adaptations for reasons unrelated to the presence of their predators , for example , since plants have complex evolutionary interactions all their own . Indeed , some classic alleged examples of co - evolution that supposedly involve lost partners are now thought to be erroneous ( see the section below on Dodos and Tambalacoque trees ) . You 're interested in the prehistory of New Zealand ? Your opinions are irrelevant unless you own Worthy & Holdaway ( 2002 ) . If you know the book , what 's wrong with the cover image shown here ? In the remainder of this article , I want to talk specifically about pieces of evidence that \u2013 so it \u2019s been suggested \u2013 represent the leftovers of co - evolutionary relationships that specifically involve birds . <P> The wax - eye is a very recent arrival in New Zealand , in fact it 's thought that it was self - introduced in the mid 1800s from Australia , perhaps when a flock of them was blown across the Tasman Sea by a storm . This little sweetie is a New Zealand robin or , more accurately , a South Island robin , since this sub - species is noticeably different than the variety that lives in the North Island of New Zealand , or the separate Stewart Island version . All of these sub - species are endemic to New Zealand , meaning that they 're found nowhere else in the world . Like the fantail , the wax - eye and quite a few other New Zealand birds , the robin is very tame and unafraid of people , which is the natural result of evolving in a country with no mammalian predators . North Island robins are n't common , but South Island robins can be seen regularly in the northern part of the island . This one was by the side of the road in the Lewis pass near the tiny settlement of Maruia . And I found this one on a different occasion , but in very nearly the same place . <P> Keas gleefully take out their vengeance not only on the destructive animals introduced by humans , but on humans themselves ! Many a skier has returned from an exhilarating day on the slopes only to find that his car has been torn to pieces , with every plastic or rubber part around the doors and windows ripped to shreds ! Somehow it seems like very appropriate payback for the thoughtless havoc that we ' ve done , and continue to do , to the original bird inhabitants of the country which were less able to defend themselves . See rare New Zealand birds living on Tiritiri Matangi island . <P> With all five kiwi species endangered , this is research that you should n't turn your nose up at . For the first several thousands of years of their existence , New Zealand kiwis ( genus Apteryx ) did not have to worry about what they smelled like \u2014 there were no mammals there to sniff them out , let alone eat them . That changed when humans came to the island , bringing stoats , rabbits , dogs , cats , pigs and a variety of other hungry critters . Now Jim Briskie , an associate professor of behavioral ecology at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch , New Zealand , has an idea to help the kiwis : create a way to minimize the birds ' aroma so they are less vulnerable to predators . He was recently awarded about $ 442,000 to research why the birds have not evolved to mask their odor , as have so many other species . \" Down the line if we do find some species are particularly smelly or vulnerable , perhaps I can design a deodorant for kiwis , \" Briskie told New Zealand 's The Press . Just to be clear , he 's not actually proposing the equivalent of an underarm stick for the birds \u2014 they do n't have arms , after all \u2014 but perhaps something that would minimize the odor of their nests . The kiwi 's distinctive scent comes from the wax it secretes to preen its feathers . Briskie compared the substance with that produced by birds in Australia , which did evolve in an environment with natural predators , and found that the continental birds did not emit as strong a scent . He thinks that the presence of predators induced the Australian birds to mask their smells , perhaps through natural selection , an adaptation that birds in New Zealand never had a chance to acquire . Briskie will now spend the next three years gather wax samples from several rare New Zealand bird species , including kiwis and the critically endangered kakapo parrot , which will be sent to a lab in Germany for testing . He hopes this will reveal which species ' smells make them more vulnerable to predators .

The responses of robins in predator - controlled Wenderholm Reserve and Tiritiri Matangi Island near Auckland were compared with those in the central North Island , where the birds have long co - existed with native and introduced predators .

The population of kiwi on Tiritiri Matangi has grown to more than 60 ( estimated at 60 - 80 birds ) from about 30 birds in 2002 . <P> Cush . Saw some more seals playing in a pool that would churn and boil every time a big wave came in . They 'd ride it around like a washing machine , having a great time . Saw a Weka , around a foot tall and solidly built but flightless like a large number of New Zealand 's native birds . Actually , somehow there was only one mammal ( a bat ) and no snakes when New Zealand separated from the main southern landmass leaving the fifty - something bird species pretty much without predators . The result is a lot of flightless birds and birds with , as John would say , \u201c pretty lax nesting habits . \u201d From 2009 - 01 - 18 Australia and New Zealand From 2009 - 01 - 18 Australia and New Zealand Question : Why do n't they sell all these sweet 4x4 Toyota and Mitsubishi vans in the US . <P> ( A Guest Post ) Pages Home About Guest Science Writers Submission Guidelines Get to Know a Scientist Career Advice Monday , February 22 , 2016 Let \u2019s Hope She Does n\u2019t Have Twins ! ( A Guest Post ) By Eric VanNatta Of all the oddball bird species in our world , the brown kiwi surly waddles in amongst the flock . Found only in the forests of New Zealand , this small flightless bird belongs to an ancient group of birds called the ratites . Joined by ostriches , emus , cassowaries and rheas , the ratites are all flightless and dressed in shaggy feathers . In addition , the ratites have all been linked to a common ancestor ( simply referred to as the ratite ) that was isolated after earth \u2019s continents shifted apart some 300 million years ago . A size comparison of the moa and kiwi . <P> However , the unique ancestry of brown kiwis is not the only thing that granted them an oddball award . The size of their eggs and their properties is something that has inspired curiosity in us ever since humans discovered the island several hundred years ago . Size comparison between an kiwi and its egg . Photo taken by Hannes Grobe at the Kauri Museum in New Zealand . Available at Wikimedia Commons . For a bird that can weigh in between 1.5 and 3.3 kilograms ( 3 - 7 pounds ) , brown kiwis \u2019 eggs are a whopping 0.4 kg ( almost a pound ) ! Due to the tremendous size of the eggs , a female kiwi only has room for one egg at a time . <P> Although these resources allowed for a change to smaller physical size , there was no reason for their eggs to reduce their size . In fact , fossil collections have shown that kiwi eggs are nearly the same size as those from the 12-kilogram ( 26 pound ) moa . Kiwis historically never had to worry about nest predators entering their burrows since there were none on the islands . Their only predators were large flying birds , so it was advantageous to keep chicks in eggs for a longer amount of time until they were more developed . The large yolk reserve also allows chicks to stay hidden during their first days of exploration , and not have to worry about eating . Talk about an odd reproductive system and a unique lineage ! Who knows , maybe future environments will present opportunities for kiwis to increase their number of offspring . <P> One of the kakapo \u2019s favorite foods is the fruit of the rimu tree . The picture below shows a kakapo eating this fruit . They have been known to eat just this fruit when it is in abundance ! Habitat and range Kakapos live only on New Zealand where they used to be safe from predators , as few or none existed . Predators were introduced , however , and in between 1980 and 1997 , all kakapos living on the two main islands of New Zealand were transported to smaller islands offshore where no mammalian predators exist . They currently live on just four islands totaling under 20 square miles ( less than 50 sq . km . ) . <P> How to get a job at DOC Search Careers News & events About us Contact You are here : Home Nature Native animals Invertebrates Powelliphanta snails Powelliphanta augusta snail Image : Kath Walker | DOC Powelliphanta snail Introduction They are among the largest snails in the world , and also among our most threatened invertebrates .

Powelliphanta superba prouseorum can grow as big as a fist . <P> Island species most at risk Species found only on islands ( insular endemics ) account for 81 % of the threatened species at risk from predators . The isolation of many islands and a lack of natural predators mean that insular species are often naive about new predators and lack appropriate defensive responses . This makes them highly vulnerable to being eaten and in turn suffering rapid population decline or , worse , extinction . The high extinction rates of ground - dwelling birds in Hawaii and New Zealand \u2014 both of which lack native mammalian predators \u2014 are well - known examples . Accordingly , the regions where the predators threatened the greatest number of species were all dominated by islands \u2013 Central America and the Caribbean , islands of the Pacific , the Madagascar region , New Zealand and Hawaii . Conversely , the continental regions of North and South America , Europe , Africa and Asia contain comparatively few species threatened by invasive predators . While Australia is a continent , it is also an island , where large numbers of native birds and mammals are threatened by cats and foxes . <P> As experts with fire , their hunting parties burnt a third of our forests , mostly the dry forests on our east coasts . When Europeans arrived about 1800 they made short work of most of the easy remaining forests with fire , too , and with their superior metal technology and thirst for money from cut timber and farmland . In 1863 one tussock fire in Canterbury burned for six weeks . Today only 23 % of New Zealand is still covered in forest , but it \u2019s worse than that for our native birds and other wildlife . Our remaining forest is nearly all high altitude , steep , mountainous and cold . Our lowland forests are mostly gone , as are most of our swamps full of flax , rich in nectar ( bird food ) . Birds lose their food sources to farming Dairy cows now graze where our swamps once were . <P> They do n\u2019t move round as fast . Eliminating indigenous birdlife European diseases were probably as hard on indigenous wildlife as they were on indigenous peoples . It \u2019s a poorly studied part of the extinction story , but bird watchers were very worried about our Bellbirds at one time . Weka disappeared over large parts of New Zealand also . So why am I telling you all this ? Because there is a long history and lots of different reasons why wildlife numbers fluctuate and some go extinct . It \u2019s not just about rats , stoats and possums . <P> Here the growing season is short , with deer and possum in balance with plant growth . There are no stoats or mice , poisoning by humans has been minimal and birdlife is spectacular . It is very similar to West Coast South Island forest before aerial 1080 poisoning . Part 7 of this series will look at the role of predators in New Zealand \u2019s biodiversity . NZ \u2019s Biodiversity 7 : The Need For Predators Introduced by Leslie Clague Jim Hilton discusses the role of predators in balancing biodiversity . The Haast Eagle and other extinguished predators By Jim Hilton The forests which the early Europeans found were also forests deprived of their large predators . Our extinct Haast Eagle was the largest bird of prey to ever exist . <P> Our famous night parrot , the Kakapo , did n\u2019t hang around the alpine tussock fields in daylight . Haast Eagles would have \u201c made them \u201d nocturnal , likewise Kiwi . Present day predatory birds We still have the night time predator , Ruru ( the morepork owl ) , but we had a larger Laughing Owl as well . But there are lots of native birds which are active predators . Cuckoos are renowned for stealing the eggs and chicks of other birds . Our lovely White Heron ( Egret ) swallow live Silvereyes and ducklings if they can catch them . They have earned pest status in Christchurch for stealing expensive goldfish from suburban fish ponds . <P> They merely replace some of the bird predators our birds have evolved with for millions of years . Sure , stoats eat birds ( See alongside ) ; rats eat a few , too . Possums take the odd egg . But the idea that birds can not cope with predators is wrong . Similar birds in overseas countries are not going extinct because of predation by wildlife like stoats and rats . Our introduced rats and possums are basically vegetarian . Rats \u2019 diets are 95 % vegetarian ; more so for possums . <P> There may be the odd bird left on Stewart Island / Rakiura . K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d live on three protected islands : Codfish Island / Whenua Hou \u2013 1,396 ha Whenua Hou is a nature reserve 3 km west of Stewart Island / Rakiura . The first k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d were transferred there in 1987 , and rats were eradicated in 1998 . Whenua Hou is the centre for K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d Recovery in New Zealand . It provides k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d with habitat very similar to their original Rakiura home . The k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d seem to like it , adding 24 chicks to the population in 2002 , 33 in 2009 and 19 in 2016 .

Desperate to save its beloved wildlife , the archipelago nation is seizing on a drastic and controversial strategy : kill all the predators . Mark Baker / AP Two shag chicks sit on a nest with their mother at Zealandia in Wellington , New Zealand , on March 22 . People across New Zealand are embracing an environmental goal so ambitious it \u2019s been compared to putting a man on the moon : ridding the entire nation of every last stoat , possum , and rat . <P> The first global analysis of established alien species , published Monday , ranked New Zealand , along with Hawaii and Indonesia , as one of the globe 's three hotspot regions for invasive species . With nearly a third of the country \u2019s endemic species at risk , including its talismanic kiwi bird , the nation has taken on a seemingly insurmountable challenge : total elimination of three invasive predators from its two main islands by the year 2050 . The endeavor has earned the moniker \u201c New Zealand \u2019s Apollo program . \u201d Non - native predators are some of the biggest threats to New Zealand wildlife . Scientists estimate that invasive stoats , rats , and possums kill 25 million native birds in the country every year . That threat looms large for New Zealanders , who view nature as \u201c almost like our church , \u201d says Nicola Toki , Threatened Species Ambassador for the New Zealand Department of Conservation ( DOC ) . \u201c Our nature is who we are , and we ca n\u2019t describe ourselves as Kiwis to the rest of the world if we do n\u2019t have any left , \u201d she says . <P> \u201c Of all the nations in the world , they have been certainly the most aggressive in dealing with this problem , \u201d he adds , especially on New Zealand \u2019s smaller islands . \u201c But the idea of eradicating introduced predators from [ the main islands ] , that \u2019s a quantum leap . \u201d Nick Perry / AP Workers assemble resetting rat traps at the Goodnature factory in Wellington , New Zealand . The world is watching The rest of the world is eagerly watching New Zealand and the PFNZ initiative . Simply perfecting eradications on uninhabited islands \u2013 which New Zealand is already close to doing \u2013 would alone have a huge impact on global conservation , says Heath Packard , the director of communications at Island Conservation , a Santa Cruz , Calif .- based nonprofit dedicated to preventing extinctions by removing invasive species from islands around the world . Island Conservation is currently struggling with its own challenges of carrying out an eradication on an inhabited island . The organization has been working for seven years to plan and fundraise for a rat eradication on Floreana Island in the Gal\u00e1pagos . <P> Protecting worms , snails , insects , and plants is just as important as looking after the more spectacular creatures . I am involved in breeding North Island wekas , birds which eat lizards and other birds ' eggs . Wekas are very rare ; we are releasing them onto islands that have no stoats or parrots ( predators that prey on wekas ) . Top of Page Why are kiwi birds found only in New Zealand ? The ancestors of kiwis were on the land that split away from an ancient continent called Gondwanaland . The kiwis evolved only in New Zealand because of the special conditions here . There were no mammals such as porcupines or hedgehogs here , and the kiwis evolved to do what those animals do in other places , such as forage around for worms and insects . <P> The ferrets are predators of the kiwi , and the possums are damaging the forests where kiwis live . My main job is educating people about keeping their dogs out of the bush ( the native vegetation ) . The scent of a kiwi is irresistible to dogs , and many kiwis are killed by dogs each year . Top of Page Are kids in New Zealand really worried about saving kiwi birds ? How are they working to save them ? To judge from the letters we get , kids in New Zealand are very worried about the kiwi disappearing . We are trying to make the kids aware of what threatens the kiwi , such as burning scrub land ( land with native vegetation that 's not used for farming ) . The biggest threat , though , comes from people 's dogs . If kids make sure their dogs do n't go off into the bush , that is a great way to save kiwi . What animals do kids in New Zealand like best ? The kiwi birds are the favorite , but kids are also interested in the weka , as we have a character in our magazine called \" Willie Weka . \" Interestingly , they also like things like wetas , the cricket - like insects we have over here . It 's good that they realize the creatures that are n't cute and cuddly are also important . Do kiwi birds have anything to do with kiwi fruit ? Do they eat kiwi fruit ? Kiwi birds have nothing to do with kiwi fruit . People in New Zealand are called kiwis , after the kiwi birds , which is a national emblem . When the Chinese gooseberry was grown over here , its name was changed to kiwi fruit to show it came from New Zealand . Kiwi birds eat worms , grubs , and insects on the forest floor ; they do n't touch kiwi fruit . Top of Page What endangered animal in New Zealand do you personally care most about ? <P> At school I studied science , math , chemistry , and physics , which I found very difficult , but very useful for my work as a scientist . I also studied biology , which is my favorite subject . I taught science and first become involved in conservation when we fought to stop a local mangrove swamp from being drained and filled in . What problems are there with conservation in New Zealand ? New Zealand is an unusual place . The people over here , including the children , are very aware of the need for conservation , but this country is one of the most difficult places to save native wildlife . The plants and animals evolved in isolation and could n't adapt to the sudden introduction of mammal predators . <P> | All About Birds \u00d7 Home Bird Guide Bird Cams Bird Academy Bird ID Skills Feeding Birds Bird Friendly Homes Problems FAQs Biology News & Features Videos Get Involved Living Bird Magazine Membership Services Support the Lab Topics Search Join Us The Cornell Lab of Ornithology All About Birds Paradise Losing : Why Is New Zealand Better Than Hawaii at Saving Its Endangered Birds ? By David S. Wilcove From the Summer 2015 issue of Living Bird magazine . <P> We never did see a Malherbe \u2019s Parakeet . Although I was certainly disappointed , I am fairly confident that if I ever make it back to New Zealand , there will still be Malherbe \u2019s Parakeets around to chase . That \u2019s because the people of New Zealand have done a truly extraordinary job of rescuing their endangered birds . And given that New Zealand is a small country with a disproportionately large number of endangered birds , that \u2019s no small accomplishment . As is the case for virtually every remote archipelago on earth , New Zealand \u2019s avifauna has been decimated by humans . The arrival of the first settlers about 1,000 years ago coincided with the disappearance of the moas ( a family of flightless birds ranging in size from turkeys to 14-foot - tall behemoths ) . Subsequent waves of settlers , especially Europeans , resulted in extensive deforestation and the introduction of a rogues \u2019 gallery of non - native predators , all to the detriment of New Zealand \u2019s native birds . According to BirdLife International , New Zealand has lost more than 8 percent of the birds that were alive as of 1500 , with roughly a third of the surviving species now classified as imperiled . The last New Zealand bird to disappear was the Bush Wren in 1972 . Since then , New Zealand has not lost another bird species , and conservationists have managed to pull many of the rarest ones back from the brink of extinction . <P> Captive - breeding programs have not been implemented in a timely fashion . For example , the Poo - uli was not brought into captivity until only three individuals remained ; not surprisingly , that last - ditch rescue effort ended in failure . And efforts to control cats , rats , and other harmful , non - native animals have stalled in the wake of resistance from animal - rights advocates . ( New Zealand , in contrast , seems far more willing and able to eradicate the non - native predators threatening its endemic birds . ) To be fair , state and federal authorities in Hawaii appear to be waking up to the crisis . Millerbirds , formerly restricted to the tiny island of Nihoa , were translocated recently to Laysan , where they are thriving . Backup populations of Laysan Ducks have been created on Midway and Kure Atoll . <P> But . Could n\u2019t it just as easily be said , \u201c Nature , red in beak and talon \u201d ? Giant eagles , hunting falcons , owls stalking in the night . New Zealand has ( or had ) its predators too . Weka : one of New Zealand \u2019s flightless birds Yet , the evolution of so many flightless birds in New Zealand suggests a lack of threat , birds from kiwi to kakapo ( a flightless parrot ) able to survive walking on two feet , no flight needed for fleeing . The mammalian threat arrived with humans , M\u0101ori first bringing dogs and rats , Europeans following with a menagerie of species , including possums and stoats . M\u0101ori and Europeans both hunted birds . <P> New Zealand \u2019s native species disappeared , one by one . A quarter of the bird species , one out of every four , are now extinct.[ii ] [ i ] Handwerk , Brian . \u201c BO Attracting Predators to Birds . \u201d National Geographic News ( 2010 ) . Web .

From the flightless Takahe to the cheeky Kea , graceful Kotuku White Herons and impressive giant Albatross , New Zealand is a must - visit destination for bird enthusiasts . The Silver Fern team are here to help you plan the ultimate trip to New Zealand ; experiencing the scenic highlights , learning about the rich culture of the country , and witnessing some of the rarest and most majestic bird species in the world , all in comfort and style . Why Visit New Zealand for Bird - Watching ? Whilst some of New Zealand \u2019s native birds , such as the Moa , were hunted to extinction after the settlers arrived , a conscious effort has been made to protect the countries birdlife . This dedication to preserving and protecting the local birds has firmly cemented New Zealand as the seabird capital of the world . Today , the endemic birds that have survived as the focus of innovative conservation projects on offshore islands making it an absolute haven for ornithology experts and birdwatching beginners alike . One of the most accessible of these islands is Tiritiri Matangi ; a Department of Conservation bird sanctuary which has been cleared of rats , cats , and other predators to allow rare and endangered birds to breed in relative safety . Following a scenic 75-minute cruise from Auckland \u2019s main harbour , visitors to the island will have the chance to spot birds including the Takahe . <P> If you \u2019d like to explore the native birdlife from the South Island , Kapiti Island is easily accessible from Wellington . Particularly enthusiastic visitors can embark on an after - dark visit to witness the Little Spotted Kiwi in its natural habitat . In the city , you \u2019ll also find the Kaori Wildlife Sanctuary . Fenced to prevent the entry of predators , the Sanctuary is home to over 30 species of native birds as well as 18kms of walking tracks winding through native New Zealand bush , not one but two lakes , and a wetlands area . Why Choose Silver Fern ? These islands are just the very tip of the ornithological iceberg that Silver Fern can help you discover . We can also arrange for you to see the world \u2019s only mainland breeding colony of Royal Albatross on the Otago Peninsula whilst our guides on the Milford and Doubtful Sound overnight cruises have particularly keen eyes and will point out dolphins , fur seals and , if you \u2019re lucky , the rare yellow - eyed Fiordland Penguins . <P> Our work Heritage Protecting species Restoring places Research and development Monitoring Managing threats Maps and data Past projects Popular Battle for our Birds K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d Recovery Icon heritage sites M\u0101ori sites Takah\u0113 Recovery Programme Bird banding Biodiversity inventory and monitoring About us Our role Our partners Our policies & plans Our structure Statutory & advisory bodies International agreements Science publications News Careers Why work at DOC ?

This could be connected to things that happen in our own country , such as trying to \" better America \" , but the road it takes to become successful seems to be only for the elite , or the ones who just get it , it does n't seem like the average person can acquire success like they used to . October 28 , 2016 at 11:55 AM Jazmyn Maggitt said ... I find the irony in the way that New Zealand has saved many species of birds from extinction but yet some of them want to rid the country of all mammalian predators . The New Zealander of the Year said,\"'Let 's get rid of the lot , ' Callaghan said . ' Let 's get rid of all the predators - all the damned mustelids , all the rats , all the possums- from the mainland'\"(176 ) . To me it almost seems like they just want to keep the \" beautiful \" creatures and not the ones that are n't so cute . <P> I am strong believer in animal rights and have been a vegetarian since 7th grade . Although I do n't particularly like possums or rats , it 's not ethical to try to gid rid of an entire species ( and also not really possible ) . On page 176 , Callaghan refers to possums and rats as \" damned mustelids . \" He also says to get rid of the rats , they have to have more birds in New Zealand . That is definitely an interesting theory and I had never heard of that before . I did n't think people particularly would want a bunch of birds arounf since they leave droppings on cars , houses , etc . All in all , this was interesting but I ' m glad we do n't have this mindset on wildlife in the United States . <P> \" . This point shows just how serious they take keeping these types of pests out of their lives . November 1 , 2016 at 6:21 PM Jeremiah B. said ... One point I found that was ironic was when Callaghan compared his own plan to that of the Apollo program ( 176 ) . The extermination of predators in New Zealand seemed like a far fetched idea in my opinion because it would be difficult to do so without harming any other animals on the islands . November 1 , 2016 at 11:41 PM Alona Davenport said ... Something that stuck out is how the animals in New Zealand are considered to be very unique to their identity ( 167 ) . It was described that the species in New Zealand are , pretty much , as important as the Constitution is in America . With that , it made the killing of the other species a little more understandable . <P> As it can not fly , the kakapo uses its wings for balance and support when hopping around . The wings are also used to break the kakapo \u2019s fall when it hops off from lower branches . A combination of these features makes the kakapo the world \u2019s largest flightless parrot . The kakapo was thought to have once thrived in New Zealand habitats due to the fact that there were no predators that would hunt the kakapo . Therefore , it has evolved into a flightless bird . In its own territory , the kakapo forages for seeds , nuts , flowers , berries , and fruits . The fruit of the rimu tree is known to be the kakapo \u2019s favorite ; and it will feed on it exclusively when the rimu fruit is in abundance . <P> For a start , many of them ca n\u2019t fly , a serious disadvantage when your enemies are land - based . New Zealand \u2019s flighless takah\u0113 . Photo : jokertrekker On top of that , instead of running away when they \u2019re in danger , our birds have evolved to stay still and rely on camouflage to avoid being seen . This might have worked a few hundred years ago when their only predators were other keen - eyed birds , but now they have animals like stoats , possums and rats to worry about . These animals rely on their keen sense of smell to find prey , so freezing on the spot is the opposite of useful . Camouflaged k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d . Photo : Mike Bodie The nests that New Zealand \u2019s native birds have been successfully raising chicks in for millennia have suddenly become unsafe with the introduction of these new predators too . The problem with the homes of birds like kiwi , kea and k\u0101k\u0101 is that they \u2019re missing an important feature \u2013 a back door . North Island brown kiwi burrow A nice hollow log or a burrow in the ground might seem like a great place to lay your eggs . You would be sheltered from the elements and hidden from the view of hungry predators . <P> There \u2019s only one entrance and exit , so if they come in and block it , there \u2019s no way you can escape . It \u2019s not that our birds are silly , they \u2019re just unprepared . They spent thousands of years on an island without furry , toothed mammals to worry about . New Zealand \u2019s predators were birds like the giant Haast \u2019s eagle , so it made sense to stick close to the ground and raise your chicks in burrows . But when humans came we brought with us some very strange animals . Furry predators with sharp teeth and quick feet . Our birds just have n\u2019t had time to adapt to this new threat yet . <P> Today three \u2014 quarters of New Zealand 's indigenous plants live nowhere else on earth . Its fauna , likewise unique , include living fossils such as the tuatara , a lizardlike reptile more ancient than the dinosaurs . All native birds are flightless , including a parrot that makes its home in underground burrows like a rabbit . Before the arrival of humans , New Zealand was free of all predators , so the birds , having no enemies , lost the use of their wings . Then the Polynesian Islanders arrived , by accident in the 10th century and for the purposes of colonizing with the arrival of the Great Fleet about a.d . 1300 . These Maori , with their dogs and ( inadvertently ) their rats , were the predatory mammals for whom flightless birds became easy prey . <P> It \u2019s a milestone for the endangered bird , which has been the subject of a marathon conservation effort following its dramatic rediscovery in 1948 .

New Zealand is gunning for you By 2050 , the nation hopes to be free of invasive predators . Mary Jo DiLonardo July 26 , 2016 , 1:24 p.m. Tweet 0 The rats in New Zealand now are mostly descendants of rats that were accidentally brought in on ships . ( Photo : M Francis McCarthy / flickr ) New Zealand has had it with predators . Rats , possums and stoats \u2014 which are n't native to the island nation \u2014 kill 25 million native birds each year , and also prey on other native species such as lizards . The invasive species carry disease and cost the country about $ 3.3 billion New Zealand dollars ( more than $ 2.3 billion ) annually , according to estimates from the government . So , their days are numbered . <P> The government is leading things off with an initial $ 28 million ( $ 19.7 million ) investment in a company called Predator Free New Zealand . The support is in addition to the $ 60 to $ 80 million already invested in pest control by the government every year . The new company 's goal will be to identify \" large , high - value predator control projects \" and help draw other investors in to increase their success . The introduction of invasive predators Stoats were brought to New Zealand to handle the overabundance of rabbits . ( Photo : CREATISTA / Shutterstock ) New Zealand has very few native mammals . According to the nation 's Department of Conservation , the only exceptions are bats and marine mammals , including many species of dolphins , seals and whales . Rats were first introduced to the island by Maori settlers as a food source more than 700 years ago , reports NPR . <P> Stoats caused the extinction of several bird species . Possums were introduced in hopes of starting a fur trade . Their prey includes snails , beetles and many native birds and they compete directly with many native birds , including the kiwi , for food and resources . The New Zealand government hopes ridding the nation of predators will help native birds , including the kiwi . ( Photo : New Zealand Department of Conservation ) Existing pest control methods in New Zealand include the controversial use of aerial poison drops , trapping and ground baiting , and possum hunting by ground hunters , according to the Guardian . Emeritus Professor of Conservation Mick Clout from the University of Auckland told the paper he was \u201c excited \u201d by the \u201c ambitious plan \u201d which if achieved would be a \u201c remarkable world first . \u201d \u201c The biggest challenge will be the rats and mice in urban areas . <P> Philanthropic economist and businessman Gareth Morgan envisions a New Zealand free of cats and his website , Cats To Go , was set up to promote the campaign . Morgan does n't suggest New Zealanders euthanize their cats ( although his website does mention it as an option ) , but he urges pet owners to keep their cats inside and not to replace them when they die . Keeping them inside is definitely a good idea . In an interview with Radio New Zealand , Key said that feral cats found on conservation lands would be targeted just like other predators .

When James Cook first arrived in New Zealand , he remarked that the sound of birdsong was deafening . It was so loud , that the men who worked in Wellington harbour had to sail out to sea in order to get some sleep . Now , in many places , this birdsong has gone quiet and New Zealand 's birds are in trouble \" . Evan Smith - the Hut Warden of Lake Mackenzie Hut on the Routeburn Track - sure knows how to make an impact with his evening talks . Having arrived in New Zealand to do our first of the nine Great Walks , we were blown away by a brutally honest analogy of what has happened in New Zealand . A very brief history Morepork or Ruru : an owl native to New Zealand New Zealand separated from Gondwana millions of years ago and was the home to a huge diversity of birds . <P> ) and could at full stretch , reach three metres . More incredible , was that the Moa were hunted by another extinct species called the Haast Eagle . This bird of prey had a wing span of three metres and was able to hunt the mighty Moa . With birds like the Haast Eagle overhead and no mammal predators , staying on the ground was the best survival method for New Zealand 's birds . This meant that many species like the Kakapo evolved to become flightless . Birds were safe on the ground and their instincts led them to be inquisitive of anything at this level , knowing that the danger was from above . Many even made their nests on the ground , this made them even more vulnerable to what was to come . <P> They 're also breeding machines with females being able to give birth to thirteen kittens if there is enough food . Even more staggeringly , female stoat kittens can be impregnated before leaving the nest , meaning the population of stoats can grow incredibly fast . I As nothing hunted the stoats , this meant that they soon became an apex predator wiping out swathes of birds in their wake . It was n't long before only a few off - shore islands were the only places in New Zealand that were predator - free . The battle for New Zealand 's birds A Kea on the Routeburn Track New Zealand is fighting back against what looks like a monumental challenge and this has been significantly through the input of national carrier Air New Zealand . Evan Smith ( remember , the warden on the Routeburn ) , told us how Air New Zealand first got involved in the fight to conserve New Zealand 's birdlife assisting with a very micro trapping program he had started around Lake Mackenzie Hut . This trapping program had an immediate impact , and sightings of highly endangered birds like Whio , Mahua , Rock Wrens and Kea slowly began . Evan had bought six traps and demonstrated how many stoats he could catch just with this small investment . Soon Air New Zealand jumped in and covered the whole track and surrounding areas with traps . The once silent valley is now beginning to come alive with birdsong again . Air New Zealand 's impact Air New Zealand 's incredible partnership with controlling predators on the Routeburn Track , does n't stop there . As well as making a difference on The Routeburn , they ' ve worked closely with the Department of Conservation to protect the Milford Track and have recently expanded this to more of the Great Walks , including Lake Waikaremoana , Abel Tasman and the Whanganui Journey . They ' ve also worked really closely with DOC to fly over 2,500 threatened native birds such as Kiwi , Takahe and Kakapo to safe places and ensure the survival of some of New Zealand 's most threatened iconic birds . This has also lead to successful breeding programs which are slowly growing the population of several birds which were on the brink of extinction . <P> Sadly the species became extinct on the mainland with the last recorded sighting in the Tararua Ranges in 1883 . Habitat loss , the introduction of mammalian predators such as cats and rats and specimen collection probably contributed to the decline of hihi on the mainland . They also appear to be especially prone to the effects of diseases , which may have been introduced to New Zealand with domestic birds . The stitchbird / hihi is one of New Zealand \u2019s rarest birds . The female birds ( pictured ) have more subdued colouring and look quite different to the male birds . Image : \u00a9 Garry Norman / Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre Hihi research An active research programme with Massey and Auckland universities , as well as other institutes such as London Zoological Society and Cambridge Univeristy , has greatly increased our knowledge of hihi biology . Did you know ? <P> The keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement.[2 ] Flightless birds also have more feathers than flying birds . New Zealand has more species of flightless birds ( including the kiwis , several species of penguins , and the takahe ) than any other country . One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago , there were no large land predators in New Zealand . The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.[3 ] Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties . This implies that flight is a significant biological cost . As soon as birds do not need to fly , there is selection against flight . <P> Flightless birds are easy to take care of in captivity because they do not have to be caged . Ostriches were once farmed for their decorative feathers . Today they are raised for meat and for their skins , which are used to make leather . There were also other families of flightless birds , such as the now extinct Phorusrhacidae , that evolved to be very powerful terrestrial predators . Contents 1 Advantages and disadvantages of flight 2 Examples of flightless birds 2.1 Ratites 2.2 Anseriformes ( Waterfowl ) 2.3 Sphenisciformes ( Penguins ) 2.4 Charadriiformes ( Gulls , Terns , Auks ) 2.5 Psittaciformes ( Parrots ) 2 6 Columbiformes ( Pigeons , Doves ) 3 Related pages 4 References 5 Other websites Advantages and disadvantages of flight[change | change source ] A flightless bird is one which has descended from ancestors which had the power of flight . It may seem strange that one of the commonest adaptations in birds is the loss of flight![4][5 ] To understand it one has to understand what the main benefits of flight are to animals which once had been confined to land . <P> Diet wise , all animals are limited primarily to forms of seed of some sort , few animals are ever fed fruits and vegetables the Pro thinks that should be fed to birds , but this seed is still nutritious enough to allow birds to live for years and years . As for neglect , birds can go through neglect from their owners , but this is not limited to birds because this affects all pets , some more than birds . The Pro claims the size of the birds is why humans dominate them , but the size of birds compared to humans are comparable to the sizes all other pets as well . Lastly , think of their harmlessness of the birds often kept as pets , many of them would not be able to survive in the real world due to their size , large number of predators , and few skills to hunt for food and water . As pets , birds enjoy life without having to worry about food , water , predators , loneliness , weather , or danger .

Before humans came to New Zealand , the song of native birds filled the forests . There were no introduced mammalian predators to kill them , and compete for food , and there were plenty of undisturbed habitats . So , many of our birds , because they didn t have enemies on the ground they needed to escape from , lost the ability to fly well or in some cases to fly at all . When humans arrived they brought rats ( excellent tree climbers ) , dogs , cats , stoats , ferrets , weasels , possums and hedgehogs ; all of them predators which found it easy to catch and kill our helpless birds which had no way to escape . <P> and Countryside Act ( 1981 ) March 2014 Table of contents Page 1 BACKGROUND ...

Thank you . Rock Wren Rock wren ( hurupounamu ) are small insect - eating birds which live at altitude in the South Island . The New Zealand wrens are an extremely significant group of birds , being the only members worldwide of the infraorder Acanthisittides . Sadly , of the half dozen New Zealand wrens known to have existed , all but two are extinct . The bush wren and the Stephens Island wren have died out since European colonisation of New Zealand . The Stephens Island wren was wiped out by the lighthouse keeper \u2019s cat in the late 1800s and the bush wren was done for by an invasion of rats onto its only remaining site in 1964 . <P> The impact of isolation from mammalian predators on the anti - predator behaviours of the North Island robin ( Petroica longipes ) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University , Auckland , New Zealand View / Open Full Text 02_whole.pdf ( 88.02Mb ) 01_front.pdf ( 1 377Mb ) Export to EndNote Abstract Conservation in New Zealand has begun to focus heavily on the restoration of degraded mainland ecosystems and the reintroduction of native species that have become locally extinct . In many cases the individuals that are selected for reintroduction are harvested from \u2018 mammal - free \u2019 offshore islands . This thesis examines the effects of isolation from mammalian predators on the predator avoidance behaviours and predator recognition abilities of New Zealand birds using the North Island robin as a model . It also investigates whether any effects of isolation from mammalian predators has a lasting impact on mainland populations founded by individuals from offshore islands . Nest site selection behaviours were compared across three populations that are exposed to different suites of predators and have differing translocation histories ; Benneydale , Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm . Point height intercept and point - centred quarter surveys were used to compare habitat availability between the sites and to compare nest sites with the available habitat . <P> The central North Island is dominated by the Volcanic Plateau , an active volcanic and thermal area . The massive Southern Alps form the backbone of the South Island . To the east of the Southern Alps is the rolling farmland of Otago and Southland , and the vast , flat Canterbury Plains . The Climate New Zealand is the first country in the world to see the sun . In Summer , New Zealand uses \u2018 Daylight Saving \u2019 , with clocks put forward one hour to GMT + 13 . Daylight saving begins on the last Sunday in September and ends on the first Sunday of the following April , when clocks are put back to GMT+12 . New Zealand has a largely temperate climate . <P> Be prepared for sudden changes in weather and temperature if you \u2019re going hiking or doing other outdoor activities . We are well known for having four seasons in one day . New Zealand observes daylight saving which means during summer months daylight can last up until 9.30pm . New Zealand experiences relatively little air pollution compared to many other countries , which makes the UV rays in our sunlight very strong . The sunniest areas are Bay of Plenty , Hawke \u2019s Bay and Nelson / Marlborough The sunlight here can quickly burn skin quickly especially between 10 am and 4 pm , even on cloudy days . Be \u2018 SunSmart \u2019 by using these three simple steps when you go outdoors : 1 . Stay in the shade whenever possible . <P> Large tracts of lush native bush supported an incredible variety of bird life . As they evloved , wings became unnecessary for some birds , as they had no natural predators to fly away from . As a result , several of New Zealand \u2019s native birds became flightless , including the kakapo parrot , the kiwi , the takahe , and the world \u2019s largest bird , the ( now extinct ) moa . As Maori and Europeans settled New Zealand , they hunted birds and brought predators including rats and stoats . This , and loss of habitat , led to the extinction of a number of birds including the moa and huia . Native birds New Zealand \u2019s national symbol is a nocturnal flightless bird with nostrils on the end of its large beak . The kiwi is now endangered , and difficult to see in the wild . <P> Home About About Career Gappers Meet Alex and Lisa Work with us Destinations Asia Brunei Indonesia Laos Malaysia Singapore Thailand Oceania Australia New Zealand South America Argentina Bolivia Brazil Chile Peru Uruguay Recommended resources Travel gear Travel services Electronics and gadgets Blogging Career break advice Travel lifestyle Travel money Contact Search Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Instagram Pinterest Menu Menu Back to Top Stories Land of the birds : the amazing evolution of avian life in New Zealand By Alex Trembath January 12 , 2018 April 17 , 2018 Leave a Comment on Land of the birds : the amazing evolution of avian life in New Zealand If any doubt remained about the veracity of evolution , we need only look to the bittersweet story of New Zealand \u2019s birds . <P> Strong evidence suggests that they are frequently getting caught up and drowned in the nets of commercial fishing trawlers . This is not the only threat ; climate change , disease and animal attacks are also contributing to its gradual disappearance , and on the current trend it faces extinction within two or three decades . My favourite of all : the kea Of all the curious and magnificent birds of New Zealand \u2019s past and presence , none captured my imagination more than the world \u2019s only alpine parrot \u2013 the kea . Native to the mountains of New Zealand \u2019s South Island , it is one of the most intelligent birds in existence . Like the kiwi and the yellow - eyed penguin , the kea is fighting to survive , with its wild population estimated between 1,000 and 5,000 . Having adapted to the harsh mountainous environment , it has become social and inquisitive in search of novel food sources . But while many find the kea \u2019s behaviour endearing , it is known to cause all sorts of mischief in its love of human gadgets . <P> Attribution William Rafti A recently published study ( 3 ) of the removal of Amur honeysuckle ( Lonicera maackii ) is an example of the loss of valuable habitat . The hypothesis of this study was that \u201c invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the underlying mechanism driving changes in bird - plant networks . \u201d The study tested this hypothesis by comparing forest plots dominated by honeysuckle with those in which honeysuckle had been removed and the surrounding forest habitat replicated . They measured nesting birds , nest predators , and nest survival . They found that the lowest overall nest survival rates were found in the plots in which honeysuckle had been removed . In other words , \u201c \u2026 removal of invasive honeysuckle from urban forests did not restore network structure to that of rural landscapes . \u201d The authors concede , \u201c This finding was not consistent with our original hypothesis that invasion of forests by the exotic Amur honeysuckle was responsible for the urban - associated changes in bird - plant networks . <P> Or maybe it was those 3 sleeping pills I took ! Flying westward through the night , we overtook the morning in time to see the clouds below us bathed in the pinks and pastels of dawn . As we descended towards earth , we glimpsed green fields and long curving shorelines . We had arrived in New Zealand ! Day 1 : November 10 When you fly from North America to New Zealand , no matter how you feel about it , a day is taken away from you when you cross the International dateline . We left LA on the evening of November 8th , and when we arrived in Auckland 12 hours later it was the morning of November 10th . For us , there was no November 9th . <P> Where do kerer\u016b live ? A kerer\u016b chick on the nest ( Photo by Abel Tasman Backpackers ) Kerer\u016b are only found in New Zealand , which means they are endemic . You can spot them in forests , parks , reserves and gardens all over New Zealand , but they are most common in the forests of Northland , the King Country , Nelson and the West Coast . Before humans and predators came to New Zealand there would have been flocks of hundreds of kerer\u016b in forests all over the country . Adults make a nest \u2013 an untidy platform of sticks in a fork of a tree or in a tangle amongst some vines . They lay just one egg in the nest , which the male and female take turns to keep warm for a month before it hatches . What do kerer\u016b sound like ? <P> Nineteen to 16 million years ago , a 5600 square kilometre megalake dominated the landscape of New Zealand \u2019s South Island . It was surrounded by a subtropical rainforest and plants typical of Australia and long lost from New Zealand , such as eucalypts , casuarinas , palms and cycads , were common there . \u201c Flightlessness in birds is often associated with an increase in size , \u201d says Ellen Mather , study lead author and PhD student at Flinders University . \u201c The weka , which is in the same family as our fossil birds and lives in New Zealand today , is about the size of a chicken . The Banded Rail , their closest flying relative , is about half that size . \" The most common of the new fossil rails has been named Priscaweka parvales , meaning ancient weka with small wings . It was a mere one twentieth of the weight of a weka and was similar in size to the recently extinct Chatham rail Cabalus modestus . Small flightless birds only exist in the absence of terrestrial mammalian predators , and New Zealand has long been recognised as the iconic example of a country with an avifauna which evolved in the absence of such predators . When humans discovered New Zealand , the main islands had many flightless birds including giants within the nine species of moa , several kiwi , two huge geese , two adzebills , even some tiny wrens , and at least five flightless rails . Team member , Dr Paul Scofield , a Senior Curator at the Natural History at Canterbury Museum , says : \" The new St Bathans \u2019 rails join a host of other fossil birds recovered from these deposits that show New Zealand has long been a land of birds . The discovery of these two miniscule flightless rails raises the question of \u2018 Where did they come from ? <P> The new Brown Teal Recovery Team appears to be operating successfully and is well managed . If the recovery efforts continue in the same manner , as in the past three years , the BTCT believes that during the next 2 - 3 years we will see brown teal numbers increasing dramatically . OVERSEAS INVOLVEMENT The first brown teal to officially be exported from New Zealand arrived at London Zoo in 1934 and from this stock the Severn Wildfowl Trust ( now the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust ) received a female in 1949 . Two pairs were sent direct to the Severn Wildfowl Trust from New Zealand in 1957 . Early observations prompted Sir Peter Scott to say that he hoped New Zealanders were not of a similar nature to brown teal . From these the first captive reared brown teal , outside New Zealand , were produced in 1960 when three brown teal were reared . Good numbers were reared from 1960 to the late 1970 \u2019s when a lack of new blood resulted in only three males surviving . <P> Unpublished PhD Thesis .

Mynas , rosellas and magpies could easily recolonise these places , but now that the mammals are gone , something is keeping them out . It seems the best way to deal with mynas ( and many other introduced birds ) is to get rid of introduced mammalian predators .

Adult Kak\u00ef look quite distinctive with their completely black plumage , long red legs and fine black bill . <P> The king of the Southern Ocean . \u201d It is , in fact , a royal albatross , sailing past us just yards away on wings spanning nearly 11 feet . Within minutes several of his congener cousins , wandering albatrosses , find our boat , along with a dozen other seabird species . Two New Zealand rarities , the Hutton \u2019s shearwater and the Westland petrel , highlight the list . The former nests at 3,000 feet in the snow - covered Seaward Kaikoura Mountains , glowing in the morning light to the west ; the latter breeds only in a limited area on the South Island \u2019s west coast . A fortuitous freak of geology brings this bounty of pelagic birds close to Kaikoura , where a deep ocean canyon lies less than a mile offshore . \u201c It \u2019s a great place here because of the nutrients from the upwellings , the plankton and the rest of the food chain , \u201d Melville says . <P> ( The species , sometimes called the blue penguin , nests in what is essentially downtown Oban . ) Once ashore , we find a flock of the small brownish songbirds called pipipis ; like many Maori - derived names , this one is onomatopoeic of the bird \u2019s peeping call . Ulva Island \u2019s impressive forest \u2014 conifers such as totara , rimu , and miro ; the red - flowered hardwood called rata ; and a lush understory of ferns , tree ferns , and orchids \u2014 is alive with tomtits , robins , riflemen , saddlebacks ( of the South Island subspecies ) , and fearless and inquisitive flightless rails called wekas . My walk on Ulva , and a return trip the next day , convince me that it has to be one of the best places in New Zealand to see native land birds . One bird alone has made Stewart Island famous , and to find it I take an evening boat ride with Phillip Smith , a former commercial fisherman who since 1990 has led birding tours to Ocean Beach , a remote spot on the island \u2019s eastern part . By the time we disembark and walk a short distance to the beach it \u2019s full dark , but on this nearly cloudless night a quarter - moon casts long shadows across the sand . In Smith \u2019s flashlight beam we can see that in places the beach is nearly covered with big three - toed footprints .",
  "answer": "I 'm not 100 % sure about this , but I 'll try . Since New Zealand is an island , it 's possible that many mammalian species could not access it . There are mammals that can swim to the island that are present , for example seals or whales . Over time , the ecological niche that mammals often occupy were filled by birds . Without traditional predators that often preyed on birds , the bird population grew and actually a lot of these birds were flightless . For the part about large birds --- I think because birds that were prey animals were getting larger , for example the Moa , the predators that ate them also got larger over time , for example the Haast eagle ."

A virus is little more than a section of RNA or DNA covered by a protein shell . The sole purpose of most viruses is to create more viruses and survive . <P> Bacterium , the singular form of the word bacteria , is a one - celled living organism , with complete sets of both ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) and deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) genetic codes . A virus is little more than a section of RNA or DNA covered by a protein shell . A bacterium , therefore , is at least a hundred times larger than a typical virus . One major difference between viruses and bacteria is the method of reproduction . A bacterium is a completely self - contained and self - reproducing unit . When the time is right , a bacterium will split its DNA and RNA genetic material in two . Separate cell walls will build up around these two new bacteria , and this process will continue until thousands or millions of bacteria have formed . <P> Once the cell bursts , thousands of new viruses repeat the process on other healthy cells . By the time the body 's natural defenses become aware of the invasion , the virus may have significant control over vital organs and tissues . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and the Ebola virus are textbook examples of what dangerous viruses can do to a human body before they run their course . Medical intervention and treatment is another major difference between viruses and bacteria . Bacteria are alive , which means they can be killed by some form of chemical agent . Antibiotics are chemical compounds that kill off bacteria by destroying their cell walls or neutralizing their ability to reproduce . The reason doctors prescribe lengthy rounds of antibiotics to patients is to create an environment in which bacteria can not live . <P> Viruses are much smaller than bacteria . Viral infections are systemic , while bacterial infections are localized . A virus requires a host cell to replicate , while bacteria reproduce through fission .

  "question": "If an animal is an herbivore ( only eats plants ) , where does it get the protein that it needs to survive if it only eats grass ? --T-- ",
  "document": "A CARNIVORE is a living thing that eats only animals . One example of this is a LION . 6 . A HERBIVORE is a living thing that eats only plants . One example of this is a DEER . 7 . What is the difference between a producer and a consumer ? <P> If an organism relies solely on one organism for food , the first organism will be in trouble if the second dies out . Individual organisms , however , do prefer specific food , but they usually vary their diets depending on what is available . The food chain refers to \" who eats whom \" relationship . For instance , humans eat hamburger which comes from the meat of a cow , which eats only grass ( herbivore ) . But humans do n't only eat meat , they eat many other items that come from both animals and plants ( omnivore ) . If you plotted the entire food habits of an organism this would be called a food web . PROCEDURE : There are many ways to refer to the components of a food web . <P> Answer : All living things need energy to live . Food chains begin with energy that comes from plants . What is the difference between an herbivore and a carnivore ? Answer : An herbivore only eats plants and a carnivore only eats meat or other animals . How do plants get energy to feed animals ? Answer : Plants get energy from the sun , water , and soil . Most people are omnivores . <P> Just like humans , animals need food to survive ! Scientist like to consider an animal \u2019s diet to learn more about how they live . Animals can be put into three categories ; carnivore , herbivore , and omnivore . A carnivore is an animal that only eats meat , an herbivore is an animal that only eats plants , and an omnivore is an animal that eats both plants and meat . Now when dealing with diets we can consider food chains . Food chains are diagrams that show what eats what . For example , a grasshopper eats grass , a mouse eats a grasshopper , a snake eats a mouse , and a hawk will eat a snake . <P> herbivore ? carnivore ? omnivore ? decomposer A consumer that eats animal material only is called a ? carnivore ? herbivore ? decomposer ? <P> Snail \u279e Blackbird \u279e Thrush ? Thrush \u279e Snail \u279e Plants Which one of the following best describes an adaptation ? ? Feature that helps an animal or plant to survive . ? A type of desert animal . ? <P> But each of us needs to eat something a little different . Edmond must eat apples- hehehe ! We \u2019re going to go over the terminology for what each animal eats from meat eaters to leaf eaters ! Carnivore : a carnivore is an animal that eats meat . There are many different animals that eat meat as the primary source of their diet . There are even plants that are carnivores . Lions are true carnivores ! They can eat up to 80 lbs in one sitting ! Herbivore : an animal that only eats vegetation and or plant material . Ellie and Edmond are both herbivores ! Herbivores come in all shapes and sizes ! They can eat everything from grass , roots , bark , seeds , flowers and fruits . Elephants are herbivores ! Omnivore : an animal that eats both plants and animals . Omnivores are a very diverse group of animals that include ; raccoons , crows , pigs , some monkeys and some species of fish ! A crow is an omnivore . Insectivore : a mammal or plant that primarily eats insects . <P> What would happen if plants did n't have a way to get energy ? What would happen to animals if there were no plants to eat ? What are some of the LIVING components of a plant \" system \" ? ( A plant \" system \" is everything that a plant needs to survive and everything it produces . ) What are some of the NON - LIVING components of a plant \" system \" ? In what ways do the components of the system interact ? What matter is transported in and out of the plant system ? <P> The plants get their food from the sun , through a process called photosynthesis . Then they take the sunlight and make it into glucose . Because they produce energy that all the rest of living things need . When a herbivore or omnivore eat the plants , they get the energy that the plants produce . And when the carnivore or omnivore eats the herbivore or omnivore , they get the energy which their prey got from the plants . If plants did n't have a way to get energy , then every living thing would die . Since the plants and producers start at the bottom of the food chin , all of the animals above the producers rely on them . So if the plants could n't get energy and die , then all of the animals on the higher part of the food chain would die . <P> ) the tail is 67 cm-1 m ( 26 1/4 in-3 1/4 ft.).The brown hyena is an herbivore . The brown hyena eats carrions .The size of the body of the brown hyena is 11.1 - 1.2 m ( 3 1/2 - 4 ft . ) , the tail is 25 - 30 cm ( 3/4 - 11 3/4in).the bison is an herbivore . It eats only grass . The size of the bison body is 2.1 - 3.5 m ( 6 3/4 - 11 1/2 ft . ) , the tail is 50 - 60 m ( 19 3/4 - 23 1/2 in).The animals adapt to the grasslands by camouflage like the lion when is going to attack an animal because it hide on the tall grass . Some animals migrate to find food also . <P> Yes , all of those plants that you see out there are using the sunlight to produce food for themselves and to help themselves grow . Many animals depend on these plants to survive . This brings us to primary consumers . Consumers Primary Consumers Primary consumers are known as herbivore in the animal world . These consumers are given the name because they are the first to eat the plant . Once the plant is eaten , the energy is transferred and then used by this animal . For e.g. : primary consumer is grasshopper that eats grass . <P> 2 Why is the amount of biomass at each stage of a food chain lass than it was at the previous stage ? \u2022 Not all organisms at one stage are eaten by the stage above \u2022 Some material and energy taken in is passed out as waste by the organism \u2022 Respiration and synthesis reactions of the organism 3 What is a producer ? A producer can make complex compounds from simpler inorganic molecules . 4 What is a herbivore ? A herbivore is an organism that only eats plants . 5 What is a carnivore ? A carnivore is an animal that eats a diet consisting mainly of meat . 6 Energy loss in waste : \u2022 Some animals can not digest all the parts of an animal that they eat , therefore some biomass is lost as faeces \u2022 When an animal eats more protein than it needs , the excess is broken down . <P> Introduction : the boreal forest or taiga exists as a nearly continuous belt of coniferous trees across north america and eurasia overlying formerly glaciated areas and areas of patchy permafrost on both continents , the forest is mosaic of successional and subclimax plant communities sensitive to varying environmental conditions .

By Justin H. Pot ; Updated April 24 , 2017 Vegetation in the desert is scarce yet manages to support a vibrant ecosystem . The carnivores of the desert \u2014 from the coyote to the various meat - eating lizards \u2014 are well known , but what eats plants in the desert ? As it turns out , quite a bit . Read on to find out what eats the desert 's scarce vegetation and in turn feeds the desert 's carnivores . Herbivores A creature that only eats plants is called a herbivore , as opposed to as carnivore ( which only eats meat ) or an omnivore ( which eats both . ) These sorts of animals make up the second tier of the food chain . They are above the plants , which are considered the producers of the food chain because of the way they convert the sun 's energy to living matter . Herbivores are below carnivores on the food chain . <P> More Articles Organisms Found in Temperate Grasslands Animals in the Savanna of Africa Plant - Eating Animals in the Rain Forest What Animals Eat Clover ?

H. , Justin . <P> Background One of the major threats to animals , particularly the Grevy \u2019s zebra , is competition with livestock for resources . It can be beneficial to protect both the livestock and the wildlife , as wildlife can also generate income , through tourism , for the community . Some communities , like Kalama in the Samburu district or Koija and Il Motiak in the Laikipia district , have designated wildlife and livestock areas to help preserve both sources of income . Materials Sticks and rocks Vocabulary Herbivore : an organism that eats mostly plants Predator : an animal that lives by killing and eating other animals Producer : an organism , usually a plant , that converts sunlight energy into living material ; usually the first step on the food chain or food web or first trophic level of a food pyramid Preparation Draw a large circle in the dirt ( not too big ; they need room to move but feel cramped when all of the children are in the circle ) . Procedure Students will play a game . Divide into two teams . <P> How does livestock affect the behaviors of wildlife ? How does wildlife affect raising livestock ? 2 . WHO EATS THE GRASS ? Students make a segmented drawing of a blade of grass . Next to each of three segments ( low , medium , high ) they draw the type of herbivore that eats down to that level ( gazelle , oryx , Grevy \u2019s zebra ) . Students make cuts in the paper so that each herbivore can be folded over the part of the grass they eat . <P> Sharing in times of need idea of love and family helps share the bounty \u2013 mutualism ( communism ) Top predator \u2013 Nothing eats him ! 5 Carnivore Teeth Adaptation What do you notice ? Crocodile and shark continue to grow new teeth Why does n\u2019t it chew for a long time ? 6 Herbivore Only eats plants Depends on a large supply of plant matter . E.g. Cow , aphid Depends on a large supply of plant matter . Longer gut as less energy available in their food . Much bigger than t rex scales and tail for defence , tend to be herd animals for defence in numbers like african zebra Slow moving not as much energy in the food and plants do n\u2019t run away ! <P> Primary Consumers Animals that eat only plants are herbivores . In a food chain , they are called the \u201c primary consumers \u201d . This is because they are the first animals that eat the plants . Energy stored in the plant moves into the herbivore when it eats the plant . This energy is then used by that herbivore . Think about you eating a fresh tomato out of your family 's garden . In that case , you are the primary consumer of the tomato . <P> But that is often not the end of the story ! Secondary Consumers Many primary consumers are very small creatures that make great snacks for larger animals . A grasshopper eats the grass and a small mammal called a shrew eats the grasshopper . The shrew becomes the \u201c secondary consumer \u201d because it eats the animal that eats the plants . Other secondary consumers can enter the picture when they , in turn , eat the first secondary consumer , in this case the shrew . These food chains can have many links . Check out this food chain : plant \u2192 grasshopper \u2192 spider \u2192 shrew \u2192 weasel \u2192 red \u2013 tailed hawk \u2192 great - horned owl The plant is the producer and the grasshopper is the primary consumer . <P> They tell how the vertebrate \u2026 feeds senses its environment communicates with other organisms defends itself against enemies 3 Exercise 1 . Tooth Types & Diet Types Tooth size , shape , and arrangement in the mouth are important determinants of the type of food an animal can obtain and consume . Teeth can be used to tell what type of diet an animal has . Four major groups of animals with respect to diet carnivore ( meat eater ) herbivore ( plant eater ) insectivore ( insect & worm eater ) omnivore ( an animal that eats a variety of foods including meat and plants ) . 4 Tooth Types ( List A ) Incisors are the flat , chisel - shaped teeth at the front of the mouth ( behind the lips ) that are used in biting , cutting , nibbling , and stripping . Canines are behind the incisors , and are located on the cheek - side of the mouth . They are cone - shaped , and may even be dagger - like . <P> As you read each card , talk about where each organism might live on a mountain . Ask : What does this animal need to eat ? Where is its habitat ? If it eats other organisms , what do those organisms need to survive ? What do the plants need ? Where will they find it ? Does the card give any clues about where on the mountain the organism lives ? <P> Predict what kinds of animals might live in each place , and jot down in your field notebook any animals you see . Remember , spiders , insects and worms are animals , too ! How do the animals you see find food , water , and shelter ? How do the plants survive ?

Sugar is the source of energy for organisms . Plants use most of the sugar to produce energy for growth , but some of it is stored in their leaves , stems , fruits , seeds , and roots ; this stored sugar is passed on through the food chain . The next link in the food chain consists of an herbivore , which is an animal that eats plants . Herbivores include : cows , horse , deer , and elk . A carnivore is the next link in the food chain . Carnivores , which include lions , bears , and alligators , hunt and eat other animals . The final link in a food chain is a decomposer . Worms , insects , fungi , and microorganisms are decomposers ; they eat dead plants and animals and turn them into soil and water . The soil produced by decomposers provides nutrients for new plants to grow and make sugar all over again . Example of a food chain : Grass makes sugar ( producer ) , mouse eats grass ( consumer / herbivore ) , owl eats mouse ( consumer / carnivore ) , insect eats owl ( decomposer ) . Students will identify the difference between a food chain and a food web . Most consumers eat more than one kind of food ; this means that they are a part of two or more food chains . Consequently , these food chains overlap to form a food web . <P> An omnivore is an animal which eats both meat and plant matterexamples would be bears , hedgehogs , pigs , rats , and chickens an omnivore is a kind of animal that eats a little bit of each main food group in the food pyramid these animals include : humans , dogs , bears , and alligators .

However , many herbivores will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein . This group also includes granivores ( animals that eat mainly seeds ) and folivores ( animals that eat mainly foliage ) . Herbivores , as there are so many required to pass energy from plants up through the food chain to the predators , are more easily defined by dividing them into two groups ; Small Herbivores This group includes the rodents , rabbits and hares . <P> Higher protein requirement then an true Omnivore but , less then an Obligate Carnivore . Omnivore : lower meat requirement then a carnivore but , must have the correct intake of protein to thrive . This protein can be animal or plant based . Herbivore : Eats only plants . Has special digestive features that obligate and lesser carnivores do not have . There is likely a correlation between \u201c dental design \u201d and digestive enzymes , bacteria and/or probiotics in the animal that would help define their appropriate diet more accurately . A guess a good question would be , if you and your dog are both Omnivores can you both digest the same stuff ? <P> What is a omnivore?An animal that consumes both meat and plants for it \u2019s nutritional requirements .

Prey- an animal that is hunted , killed , and eaten by another animals . Scavenger- an animal that feeds on the bodies of dead organisms . Initial Introduction : Start by bringing in a small animal to the classroom ( ex . <P> In a sense , herbivores can never be carnivores as much as carnivores can not be herbivores . However , omnivores are animals which can be both a herbivore and carnivore . Humans are a perfect example . Herbivores When an animal only eats plants , it is called an herbivore . Leafy plants , fruits , seeds , or grass are some examples of plant foods . Teeth structure is one of the easily distinguishable characteristics of herbivores . Since they feed on plants alone , they have teeth that are flat , broad , and dull - edged . <P> 4 ) Describe a food chain . Begin by listing your favorite food . Are you a carnivore or an herbivore ? If you are an herbivore , what animal tries to hunt you ? How have you kept from being eaten so far ? 5 ) Describe a food web .

If you \u2019 ve ever wondered why humans are so numerous , now you know . The grass is then devoured mercilessly The deer is a consumer , which is the opposite of a producer in that it has to eat stuff to get energy . A deer is also an herbivore \u2014 it only eats plants . Deer belong to the suborder Ruminantia , which also includes sheep , antelope , goats , and cows . They are cud - chewers , which basically means they eat grass , throw it up in their mouths , and eat it again so they can extract every possible nutrient from it . It \u2019s gross , but ruminants do n\u2019t think so . <P> That swordolphin is kind of simple , but you can get about as complicated as you want , so as long as \u2026 It occupies a certain niche ( browsing herbivore ? small carnivore ? large omnivore ? ) It has tools to survive ( speed , armor , size , stealth , weapon , a combination of those ) It has a way to get food ( lives on the plains , has flat teeth , and eats grass ? lives in the desert , has sharp teeth , and eats lizards ? filter - feeder in the ocean ? ) It has a way to find a mate and reproduce ( a song to attract a mate ? <P> Key Words : These words are introduced to the student in the context of this section . Students should be encouraged to add these words to their Personal Word Glossary , their journals , and to the word wall . Producer green plants . Consumer an animal that eats plants or other animals . Although students are not introduced to these finer distinctions in early years , there are several levels of consumers . Accepted terminology includes , primary , secondary , and tertiary consumers , depending on where in the food chain these animals lie . Herbivores animals that eat plants only . <P> Some examples of omnivores are raccoons , skunks , and bears . It might be easier to keep these straight if you know where the words came from : Herbivore Carnivore Omnivore is from the Latin words herba , which means grass and vovare which means to swallow . So herbivorus ( say her- biveress ) means an animal that swallows grass is from the Latin words carn , which means flesh and vovare . So carnivorus ( say car niveress ) means an animal that eats meat ( or flesh ) . This is the same place the Spanish word for meat comes from . is from the Latin word omni , which means all and vovare . So omnivorus ( say om - niveress ) means an animal that eats everything . Remember this omni prefix because you will see this a lot in your studies . Sometimes all these different consumers are trying to eat the same things . For example , hawks and owls might be fighting over the same mouse . <P> Here \u2019s why : Bacteria is what eats food inside of you . Bacteria is what breaks down a grain or seed so it can turn into grass or a plant or tree . Bacteria is what eats the plant . When animals eat grass or plants , it \u2019s the bacteria inside the animal that eats the plant . If an animal eats another animal ( insect or whatever ) , it \u2019s still bacteria inside the animal that eats the other animal . I \u2019 m over simplifying and generalizing here . When I say bacteria , I know that in some cases there will be yeast , fungi or little worms involved in eating the food in all these cases . Even in soil it \u2019s bacteria that eats leftovers and turn it into rich compost where seeds and grains can grow . <P> You see , when there are just aphids and plants , a really simple system , the system can be heavily impacted by a large event like a heat wave . It gets hot , the aphids die , the plant cheers with relief \u2026 if it can survive the heat itself . But typically ecosystems are never so simple . More commonly there is an herb ( plant ) , an herbivore ( animal that eats the plant ) and also , a predator ( that eats the herbivore ) . Think about it : spiders , tigers , wolves ; these are all predators that feed on herbivores in different ecosystems . If you took out the predator , say like we did with the wolf , what do you think will happen to the herbivore , in this example the deer population ? Well the deer just start marching around thinking they own the place , eating your flowers , crapping on your lawn \u2026 .Jerks . <P> An example of a food chain is : grass eaten by an insect , which is eaten by a frog , which is eaten by a snake , which is eaten by an owl . The owl is at the top of this food chain . Food web : the feeding relationships between all of the members of an ecosystem . Herbivore : a consumer that eats only plants ; deer , sheep and rabbits are herbivores . Mutualism : a symbiotic relationship between two species in which both of the organisms benefit . An example of mutualism is the relationship between bees and flowers . The bees benefit by getting nectar , and the flowers benefit by having their pollen transferred to other flowers . <P> Plants need it and sunlight to carry out photosynthesis , Animals need it to digest food and release energy stored in food . Ecosystems with a lot of water can support a large number of plants , and these plants can support a large number of different types of animals . Sunlight It \u2019s necessary for photosynthesis . If the plants do n\u2019t get it they ca n\u2019t survive . The strength ofthe sunlight and amount of sunlight will determine the type of plants that can survive No plants means no food for other organisms . It also warms the Earth \u2019s surface . It \u2019s also a factor in ocean ecosystems because the deeper the water , the less light will be available . <P> foodchains bingo 1 .

Humans can eat plants and animals . Here are some examples : Omnivore - A human is an omnivore because it eats plants and animals / meat . Herbivore - An elephant is an herbivore because it eats plants . Carnivore - A fox is a carnivore because it eats meats / animals . Choices : sun plants carnivore animals omnivore herbivore What are animals that only eat plants called ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ What are animals which only eat meat called ? <P> Veganism is a lifestyle where no animals are harmed . In order to live this lifestyle obviously one needs to not eat any sort of animal products in their diet . So let \u2019s start by defining the three broad types of diets : carnivore , omnivore and herbivore . A vegan eats a strictly herbivore style diet . Within the herbivore diet there are all sorts of foods . Some very healthy and many not so much . Which is why being diet is not necessarily healthy . <P> Dogs are carnivores and their diet is largely based on meat and meat products . But dogs are very adaptable and they often like to eat vegetables and other types of food . Most dogs , unless they are very spoiled , are not picky eaters , so if you find your dog eating from your garbage or chewing on things like paper sacks from the grocery store , do n\u2019t be alarmed . The definition of an herbivore is an animal that eats mainly grass and other plants . An omnivore is an animal that eats both meats and grass or plants . So if you wanted to be technical , you could say that a dog is an omnivore if it eats both meats and greens . There are some theories that possibly explain why dogs like to eat grass and green plants . If a dog has an upset stomach it will be inclined to munch on grass because it stimulates vomiting and relieves the queasiness in the dog \u2019s stomach . <P> The bio - mass of grass and plants supplies food and energy to these animals like cow and buffalo . It should be noted that the consumer organisms like animals can not prepare food from simple inorganic substances through photosynthesis . The consumers need ready - made food for their survival which they get from producers ( green plants ) , either directly or indirectly . If an animal eats grass or other green plants or their products itself we say that it gets the food from producers directly . For example , a goat gets the food from producers directly when it eats grass . On the other hand , if an animal eats the meat of another animal ( which eats grass ) , then we say that it gets the food from producer indirectly . For example , a lion gets food by eating goat which in turn eats grass . So , in this case the lion gets its food indirectly from producer grass ( through the goat ) . Consumer organisms are also called heterotrophs . <P> Those animals which eat only plants are called herbivores . The herbivores may eat grasses , leaves , grains , fruits or the bark of trees . Some of the examples of herbivores are : Cow , Buffalo , Goat , Sheep , Horse , Deer , Camel , Ass , Ox , Elephant , Monkey , Squirrel , Rabbit and Hippopotamus . Cow is called an herbivore because it eats only plants ( or plant products ) as food . Herbivores are also known as herbivorous animals . The animals which get their food by eating the producers ( plants ) directly are called primary consumers . Since herbivores obtain their food directly from plants ( or producers ) , therefore , herbivores ( like cattle , deer , goat , etc .",
  "answer": "Herbivores only eat plants , but unlike humans they have special digestive systems that let them get protein from grass . Plants contain cellulose , which is difficult for humans to digest . However , animals like cows have special digestive systems that can process the cellulose and then access nutrition like protein that are protected by the cellulose in plant cells . A lot of herbivores have multiple stomachs ( like cows ) or special areas in the stomach or intestine that can help in digesting plants ."
