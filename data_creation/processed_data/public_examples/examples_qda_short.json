  "question": "How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- ",
  "document": "URL_0 Posted by Amy Rubin at 6:58 AM 4 comments : Rachel Phillips June 8 , 2012 at 10:24 AM This topic was also one of my favorites . I think it is so interesting how we can perceive so many different shades of color . Just looking out the window we can see several different shades of green in all of the different plants . <P> After all , when one keeps in mind that the grayscale counts here as a color , it is hard ( though perhaps not impossible ? ) to defend the thesis that animals perceive , but do not in any way perceive colors . If colors are thought to be out in the world , then there seems no in - principle difficulty in allowing other animals to perceive them . <P> Here is where the question about other animals becomes most interesting . One might suppose that , if colors are not in the world , then surely animals can not perceive them . Consider the case of Galileo , who famously claims that colors reside only \" in consciousness . <P> Actually , however , what Galileo says in the The Assayer is not that color resides in consciousness , as the standard English translation has it , but that they reside \" nel corpo sensitivo . \" This would seem to leave plenty of room for other animals to perceive colors . What the colors are , on this view , would be physical phenomena within the right sort of perceptual faculties , caused by certain patterns of light in the world . <P> According to Malebranche , for instance , \" the heat we sense and the colors we see are only in the soul \" ( Search after Truth VI.2.2 ) . Since animals , for Malebranche , have no souls , they can not perceive colors . This seems to be Descartes 's view as well , at least in those places where he wants to locate colors in perceivers rather than in the world . <P> There is really no way to know what colors animals see , because color is not an objective property of the world , but rather an artifact of perception \u2014 something the brain constructs to distinguish different frequencies of light . Thus , saying that many animals can perceive color just means that they can distinguish different colors . Usually these are colors that are important to their survival . <P> , et al . \u201c What Colors Do Animals See ? \u201d WebExhibits / Causes of Color . <P> Most of the world 's languages have five basic color terms , others divide all colors by \" light \" and \" dark , \" while others categorize the color blue into lighter and darker shades . The human eye can physically perceive millions of colors . But we do n't all recognise these in the same way . <P> Thus , they see only certain colors of the color spectrum and are said to have dichromatic vision . So , which are the different colors a dog can see ? Researchers state that dogs can identify shades of grey , selected shades of blue and shades between brown to yellow on the color spectrum . <P> Perceiving colors in ' the real world ' : Mostly colors are studied in the laboratory under very artificial conditions . My reserach involves how we perceive colors in ' the real world ' . Under daily circumstances , we are not fooled by differences in changes in background color or under changes in illumination ( eg . <P> Some insects are trichromats ; for example , honeybees that can distinguish between ultraviolet , blue and green light . How Trichromats Perceive Colors ? Color vision is the ability of an organism to distinguish between colors . <P> What do animals see ? Can other animals see colors ? Do they see more or less color than humans ? <P> For example they also discussed how cultures may not perceive a color as easily when they do not have a word for it than when they do have a word for a certain color . The labeling of the word , to some extent , affects how we perceive colors . One doctor raised her daughter teaching her all the colors . <P> What are Colors ? All the colors we perceive are an effect of light . The seemingly colorless sunlight actually contains all the colors we can see , but at different wavelengths . <P> This property of the object changes as the object changes , which is why a raw banana would look green , and a rotting banana would appear blackish . Why do we see different Colors ? How do we know which color is which , i. e. how does our brain know the difference between these colors ?",
  "answer": "Larger animals ( including humans ) have special cells in the back of their eyes called cone cells . Each type of cone cell reacts to a specific wavelength : that is , light whose color corresponds to a specific part of the rainbow . When the cell is hit by light with the right wavelength , it sends a signal to the brain , which combines information from all of the cone types to perceive the full color range . What colors each animal sees depends on the number of different cone types , and what wavelength they react to . For example , most humans have three cell types which perceive violet , green , and yellow , but some of us lack one of these types , leading to green - red color - blindness . Some species of bird or fish on the other hand have four different cell types , giving them a very different perception of colors ."

  "question": "Why are flutes classified as woodwinds when most of them are made out of metal ? --T-- ",
  "document": "Each woodwind is played by blowing into them and fingering different holes to produce a different sound . Most of these instruments are made with wood . Flutes can be made either with wood or metal , though those used in an orchestra are usually made of metal . <P> Check local tag sales or church bazaars . Classified ad newspapers will often have them . But keep this point in mind ! <P> Some ethnic woodwinds have even more reeds , with up to four . Some of these woodwinds are made from wood , but most of them include metallic elements , or are made entirely from metal . Although some woodwinds could be confused with brass instruments , since they are made entirely from metal , they have a very different sound . <P> First , there is the material used for the body . While most flutes are made of metal , nowadays the majority of piccolos are made of wood . This is because the piccolo has a higher register , and metal piccolos can sound too piercing and therefore not blend well with other instruments . <P> The soprano sax is pitched one octave higher than the tenor sax , and the alto sax is pitched one octave higher than the bari sax . Even though the saxophone is made out of brass , it is classified as a woodwind instrument because a single wooden reed is used to produce sound . The saxophone is still young when compared to other instruments . <P> The best sounding clarinets are made of wood , but there are several plastic varieties . Keys on the instrument are made of metal . Pieces of the clarinet are the bell ( cone shape at the bottom ) , two main body pieces , mouthpiece , single wood reed , and a ligature that holds the reed on the mouthpiece . <P> Press Room Reports & Financials Contact Us Home > Learning & Community > Instruments of the Orchestra > Woodwinds The Woodwind Family The instruments in this family all used to be made of wood , which gives them their name . Today , they are made of wood , metal , plastic or some combination . They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes , with holes , an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top . <P> Membranophones Membranophones are musical instruments that use vibrating stretched membranes or skin to produce sound . Membranophones are classified according to the shape of the instrument . Kettle Drums \u2014 Also known as vessel drums , these are rounded at the bottom and may be tunable or non - tunable . <P> They are very unique , but still have always been considered woodwinds . Flutes used to be made of wood ; however , now they are made of metal . Reeds , and keys are the easiest ways to identify an instrument as woodwind , brass instruments typically have valves or slides . <P> Various devices , such as mutes , and various techniques ( for example , on stringed instruments , pizzicato and the harmonic , or flageolet tone ) can alter the sound of an instrument . Musical instruments are usually classified as folk and professional instruments . Folk instruments may be unique ( found among a single people ) or \u201c international\u201d\u2014that is , widely used by various peoples with ethnic or long - standing historical and cultural ties . <P> When choosing a piccolo , you can choose from a variety of materials . The most common are metal , plastic , and wood . Plastic is the cheapest , followed by metal , and wood is more expensive . <P> The warm timbre that is produced possesses great charm . Flutes are always woodwinds , even when they are made of metals , because that is what they are classified as - woodwind instruments - within the conventional system of classification of musical instruments . Woodwind instruments fall under one of two sub - classifications : flutes , and reed instruments . <P> Traditionally they were always made of wood , although some of them are now made of metal or plastic . In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument . <P> There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute . Flutes are still sometimes made of wood , but mostly they are metal . The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute . <P> WOODWINDS FLUTE The flute , while part of the woodwind family , is not a reed instrument . It is classified as being an aerophone . Sound emitted from the flute is the result of air flow across the opening on the flute .",
  "answer": "Contrary to what the name suggests , the difference between woodwinds and brass instruments is about how the sound is produced rather than what material they are made of . By and large , brass instruments amplify or modify the sound produced by lips vibrating against each other , while woodwinds create their own sound when wind is directed through them . This can happen by vibrating a reed in the case of oboes or clarinets , or by vibrating the air column contained within a transverse flute or a recorder , which is why they are called woodwinds ."

  "answer": "The exact beginning or end date of artistic periods that are taught in school are mostly arbitrary . Art historians usually try to use a major event or the creation of an art piece that features characteristics of the new period , or the death of a representative character . For example , the Baroque period is widely thought to start with the first representation of the first Baroque opera , l'Orfeo , in 1607 , and end with the death of its most famous composer , Johann Sebastian Bach , in 1750 . However , musical styles had actually started changing long before Bach passed away , and were already exhibiting features of what was to become known as the Classical period . In general these dates are mostly just a way to remember which period came after which and what decades they cover ."

  "question": "Why were the main predators in New Zealand large birds , compared to other places in the world ? --T-- ",
  "document": "North Island Brown Kiwi . New Zealand Birds Online , URL_8 . \u201c Scientific American . <P> The moa occupied the same niche as grazing animals like deer and antelopes , and Haast 's eagle was the apex predator , the equivalent of the big cats of Africa , Asia and the Americas . Because of the lack of predators , about a third of New Zealand birds were flightless . Naturally enough , all eleven species of moa were flightless , but so were many smaller forest birds like kiwis , wekas , takahes and dozens of others . <P> Strange things happen when you leave a few species alone on a distant island for a few million years . Places like New Zealand , Australia , Madagascar , and Hawaii are ( or were ) full of plants and animals that seem alien compared to rest - of - the - world standards . This is often due to a set of conditions and evolutionary challenges unlike those seen on the continent . <P> New Zealand is a land dominated by birds . Until humans began to arrive on our shores 700 odd years ago New Zealand 's only land mammals were small bats , so our native species evolved over millions of years without land mammals . <P> Wekas are very rare ; we are releasing them onto islands that have no stoats or parrots ( predators that prey on wekas ) . Top of Page Why are kiwi birds found only in New Zealand ? The ancestors of kiwis were on the land that split away from an ancient continent called Gondwanaland . <P> Giant eagles , hunting falcons , owls stalking in the night . New Zealand has ( or had ) its predators too . Weka : one of New Zealand \u2019s flightless birds Yet , the evolution of so many flightless birds in New Zealand suggests a lack of threat , birds from kiwi to kakapo ( a flightless parrot ) able to survive walking on two feet , no flight needed for fleeing . <P> For a start , many of them ca n\u2019t fly , a serious disadvantage when your enemies are land - based . New Zealand \u2019s flighless takah\u0113 . Photo : jokertrekker On top of that , instead of running away when they \u2019re in danger , our birds have evolved to stay still and rely on camouflage to avoid being seen . <P> They spent thousands of years on an island without furry , toothed mammals to worry about . New Zealand \u2019s predators were birds like the giant Haast \u2019s eagle , so it made sense to stick close to the ground and raise your chicks in burrows . But when humans came we brought with us some very strange animals . <P> All native birds are flightless , including a parrot that makes its home in underground burrows like a rabbit . Before the arrival of humans , New Zealand was free of all predators , so the birds , having no enemies , lost the use of their wings . Then the Polynesian Islanders arrived , by accident in the 10th century and for the purposes of colonizing with the arrival of the Great Fleet about a.d . <P> Their prey includes snails , beetles and many native birds and they compete directly with many native birds , including the kiwi , for food and resources . The New Zealand government hopes ridding the nation of predators will help native birds , including the kiwi . ( Photo : New Zealand Department of Conservation ) Existing pest control methods in New Zealand include the controversial use of aerial poison drops , trapping and ground baiting , and possum hunting by ground hunters , according to the Guardian . <P> They also appear to be especially prone to the effects of diseases , which may have been introduced to New Zealand with domestic birds . The stitchbird / hihi is one of New Zealand \u2019s rarest birds . The female birds ( pictured ) have more subdued colouring and look quite different to the male birds . <P> New Zealand has more species of flightless birds ( including the kiwis , several species of penguins , and the takahe ) than any other country . One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago , there were no large land predators in New Zealand . The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.[3 ] Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties . <P> Wellington , The Ornithological Society of New Zealand , Inc.

  "answer": "I 'm not 100 % sure about this , but I 'll try . Since New Zealand is an island , it 's possible that many mammalian species could not access it . There are mammals that can swim to the island that are present , for example seals or whales . Over time , the ecological niche that mammals often occupy were filled by birds . Without traditional predators that often preyed on birds , the bird population grew and actually a lot of these birds were flightless .
