<s2s_qd_a> <startQuestion> How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- URL_0 Posted by Amy Rub@@ in at 6@@ :58 AM 4 comments : Rachel Phillips June 8 , 2012 at 10:@@ 24 AM This topic was also one of my favorites . I think it is so interesting how we can perceive so many different shades of color . Just looking out the window we can see several different shades of green in all of the different plants . <D> After all , when one keeps in mind that the gray@@ scale counts here as a color , it is hard ( though perhaps not impossible ? ) to defend the thesis that animals perceive , but do not in any way perceive colors . If colors are thought to be out in the world , then there seems no in - principle difficulty in allowing other animals to perceive them . <D> Here is where the question about other animals becomes most interesting . One might suppose that , if colors are not in the world , then surely animals can not perceive them . Consider the case of Galileo , who famously claims that colors reside only " in consciousness . <D> Actually , however , what Galileo says in the The Ass@@ ay@@ er is not that color resides in consciousness , as the standard English translation has it , but that they reside " nel cor@@ po sensi@@ tiv@@ o . " This would seem to leave plenty of room for other animals to perceive colors . What the colors are , on this view , would be physical phenomena within the right sort of percep@@ tual fac@@ ulties , caused by certain patterns of light in the world . <D> According to Mal@@ ebr@@ anche , for instance , " the heat we sense and the colors we see are only in the soul " ( Search after Truth VI@@ .@@ 2.2 ) . Since animals , for Mal@@ ebr@@ anche , have no souls , they can not perceive colors . This seems to be Descartes 's view as well , at least in those places where he wants to locate colors in percei@@ vers rather than in the world . <D> There is really no way to know what colors animals see , because color is not an objective property of the world , but rather an artifact of perception — something the brain construc@@ ts to distinguish different frequencies of light . Thus , saying that many animals can perceive color just means that they can distinguish different colors . Usually these are colors that are important to their survival . <D> , et al . “ What Colors Do Animals See ? ” Web@@ Exhi@@ bits / Causes of Color . <D> Most of the world 's languages have five basic color terms , others divide all colors by " light " and " dark , " while others categorize the color blue into lighter and darker shades . The human eye can physically perceive millions of colors . But we do n't all recognise these in the same way . <D> Thus , they see only certain colors of the color spectrum and are said to have dic@@ h@@ ro@@ matic vision . So , which are the different colors a dog can see ? Researchers state that dogs can identify shades of grey , selected shades of blue and shades between brown to yellow on the color spectrum . <D> Per@@ cei@@ ving colors in ' the real world ' : Mostly colors are studied in the laboratory under very artificial conditions . My reser@@ ach involves how we perceive colors in ' the real world ' . Under daily circumstances , we are not fooled by differences in changes in background color or under changes in illumination ( eg . <D> Some insects are tr@@ ich@@ ro@@ mats ; for example , honey@@ bees that can distinguish between ultraviolet , blue and green light . How Tr@@ ich@@ ro@@ mats Per@@ cei@@ ve Colors ? Color vision is the ability of an organism to distinguish between colors . <D> What do animals see ? Can other animals see colors ? Do they see more or less color than humans ? <D> For example they also discussed how cultures may not perceive a color as easily when they do not have a word for it than when they do have a word for a certain color . The labeling of the word , to some extent , affects how we perceive colors . One doctor raised her daughter teaching her all the colors . <D> What are Colors ? All the colors we perceive are an effect of light . The seemingly colorless sunlight actually contains all the colors we can see , but at different wavelengths . <D> This property of the object changes as the object changes , which is why a raw banana would look green , and a rotting banana would appear black@@ ish . Why do we see different Colors ? How do we know which color is which , i. e. how does our brain know the difference between these colors ?
<s2s_qd_a> <startQuestion> Why are fl@@ utes classified as wood@@ winds when most of them are made out of metal ? --T-- Each wood@@ wind is played by blowing into them and fing@@ ering different holes to produce a different sound . Most of these instruments are made with wood . Fl@@ utes can be made either with wood or metal , though those used in an orchestra are usually made of metal . <D> Check local tag sales or church b@@ az@@ a@@ ars . Classi@@ fied ad newspapers will often have them . But keep this point in mind ! <D> Some ethnic wood@@ winds have even more ree@@ ds , with up to four . Some of these wood@@ winds are made from wood , but most of them include metallic elements , or are made entirely from metal . Although some wood@@ winds could be confused with brass instruments , since they are made entirely from metal , they have a very different sound . <D> First , there is the material used for the body . While most fl@@ utes are made of metal , nowadays the majority of pic@@ co@@ los are made of wood . This is because the pic@@ col@@ o has a higher register , and metal pic@@ co@@ los can sound too piercing and therefore not blend well with other instruments . <D> The sop@@ rano sa@@ x is pitched one octave higher than the ten@@ or sa@@ x , and the al@@ to sa@@ x is pitched one octave higher than the bar@@ i sa@@ x . Even though the sax@@ ophone is made out of brass , it is classified as a wood@@ wind instrument because a single wooden re@@ ed is used to produce sound . The sax@@ ophone is still young when compared to other instruments . <D> The best sounding clar@@ inets are made of wood , but there are several plastic varieties . Keys on the instrument are made of metal . Pieces of the clar@@ inet are the bell ( cone shape at the bottom ) , two main body pieces , mouth@@ piece , single wood re@@ ed , and a lig@@ ature that holds the re@@ ed on the mouth@@ piece . <D> Press Room Reports & Fin@@ an@@ cials Contact Us Home > Learning & Community > Instruments of the Orchestra > Wood@@ winds The Wood@@ wind Family The instruments in this family all used to be made of wood , which gives them their name . Today , they are made of wood , metal , plastic or some combination . They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes , with holes , an opening at the bottom end and a mouth@@ piece at the top . <D> Mem@@ bran@@ oph@@ ones Mem@@ bran@@ oph@@ ones are musical instruments that use vibrating stretched membranes or skin to produce sound . Mem@@ bran@@ oph@@ ones are classified according to the shape of the instrument . Kettle Dr@@ ums — Also known as vessel drums , these are rounded at the bottom and may be tun@@ able or non - tun@@ able . <D> They are very unique , but still have always been considered wood@@ winds . Fl@@ utes used to be made of wood ; however , now they are made of metal . Re@@ eds , and keys are the easiest ways to identify an instrument as wood@@ wind , brass instruments typically have valves or slides . <D> Various devices , such as m@@ utes , and various techniques ( for example , on string@@ ed instruments , p@@ izz@@ ic@@ ato and the harmonic , or fl@@ age@@ olet tone ) can alter the sound of an instrument . Musical instruments are usually classified as folk and professional instruments . Folk instruments may be unique ( found among a single people ) or “ inter@@ nation@@ al@@ ”—@@ that is , widely used by various peoples with ethnic or long - standing historical and cultural ties . <D> When choosing a pic@@ col@@ o , you can choose from a variety of materials . The most common are metal , plastic , and wood . Plastic is the cheapest , followed by metal , and wood is more expensive . <D> The warm timbre that is produced possesses great charm . Fl@@ utes are always wood@@ winds , even when they are made of metals , because that is what they are classified as - wood@@ wind instruments - within the conventional system of classification of musical instruments . Wood@@ wind instruments fall under one of two sub - classifications : fl@@ utes , and re@@ ed instruments . <D> Traditionally they were always made of wood , although some of them are now made of metal or plastic . In an orchestra there are four main types of wood@@ wind instrument . <D> There is also an al@@ to flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute . Fl@@ utes are still sometimes made of wood , but mostly they are metal . The o@@ bo@@ e can play slightly lower than the flute . <D> W@@ OO@@ D@@ WIN@@ DS FL@@ UT@@ E The flute , while part of the wood@@ wind family , is not a re@@ ed instrument . It is classified as being an aer@@ ophone . Sound emitted from the flute is the result of air flow across the opening on the flute .

<s2s_qd_a> <startQuestion> Why were the main predators in New Zealand large birds , compared to other places in the world ? --T-- North Island Brown Ki@@ wi . New Zealand Birds Online , URL_8 . “ Scientific American . <D> The mo@@ a occupied the same niche as gra@@ zing animals like deer and ant@@ el@@ opes , and Ha@@ ast 's eagle was the apex predator , the equivalent of the big cats of Africa , Asia and the Americas .

Naturally enough , all eleven species of mo@@ a were f@@ light@@ less , but so were many smaller forest birds like ki@@ wis , we@@ kas , ta@@ k@@ ah@@ es and dozens of others . <D> Strange things happen when you leave a few species alone on a distant island for a few million years . Places like New Zealand , Australia , Mad@@ agas@@ car , and Hawaii are ( or were ) full of plants and animals that seem alien compared to rest - of - the - world standards . This is often due to a set of conditions and evolutionary challenges unlike those seen on the continent . <D> New Zealand is a land dominated by birds . Until humans began to arrive on our sho@@ res 700 odd years ago New Zealand 's only land mammals were small bats , so our native species evolved over millions of years without land mammals . <D> We@@ kas are very rare ; we are releasing them onto islands that have no sto@@ ats or parrots ( predators that prey on we@@ kas ) .

New Zealand ’s f@@ ligh@@ less ta@@ k@@ ah@@ ē . Photo : jo@@ ker@@ tre@@ k@@ ker On top of that , instead of running away when they ’re in danger , our birds have evolved to stay still and rely on camouflage to avoid being seen . <D> They spent thousands of years on an island without furry , tooth@@ ed mammals to worry about . New Zealand ’s predators were birds like the giant Ha@@ ast ’s eagle , so it made sense to stick close to the ground and raise your chicks in bur@@ rows . But when humans came we brought with us some very strange animals . <D> All native birds are f@@ light@@ less , including a parrot that makes its home in underground bur@@ rows like a rabbit . Before the arrival of humans , New Zealand was free of all predators , so the birds , having no enemies , lost the use of their wings .
