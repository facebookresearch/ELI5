  "question": "How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- ",
  "answer": "Larger animals ( including humans ) have special cells in the back of their eyes called cone cells . Each type of cone cell reacts to a specific wavelength : that is , light whose color corresponds to a specific part of the rainbow . When the cell is hit by light with the right wavelength , it sends a signal to the brain , which combines information from all of the cone types to perceive the full color range . What colors each animal sees depends on the number of different cone types , and what wavelength they react to . For example , most humans have three cell types which perceive violet , green , and yellow , but some of us lack one of these types , leading to green - red color - blindness . Some species of bird or fish on the other hand have four different cell types , giving them a very different perception of colors .",
  "short_doc_set": "Thus , saying that many animals can perceive color just means that they can distinguish different colors . Usually these are colors that are important to their survival . My reserach involves how we perceive colors in ' the real world ' . Under daily circumstances , we are not fooled by differences in changes in background color or under changes in illumination ( eg . How Trichromats Perceive Colors ?",
  "long_doc_set": "But the logic behind the effects of colors on emotions is little different , as actually you do n\u2019t see colors but perceive wavelength of the electromagnetic waves . They have three receptor types , although unlike humans they are sensitive to ultraviolet light , with loss of sensitivity at the red end of the spectrum . All other animals , I had thought , have only brightness - detector cells \u2014 that is , rods \u2014 and , therefore , can not distinguish different colors . Color vision is the result of the brain integrating the responses of visual pigments , called rhodopsins , each responding to distinctly different wavelengths of light . Colors that have wavelengths that are either less or more than this visible spectrum are invisible to us ."

  "question": "Why are flutes classified as woodwinds when most of them are made out of metal ? --T-- ",
  "answer": "Contrary to what the name suggests , the difference between woodwinds and brass instruments is about how the sound is produced rather than what material they are made of . By and large , brass instruments amplify or modify the sound produced by lips vibrating against each other , while woodwinds create their own sound when wind is directed through them . This can happen by vibrating a reed in the case of oboes or clarinets , or by vibrating the air column contained within a transverse flute or a recorder , which is why they are called woodwinds .",
  "short_doc_set": "This is because the piccolo has a higher register , and metal piccolos can sound too piercing and therefore not blend well with other instruments . Musical instruments are usually classified as folk and professional instruments . They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes , with holes , an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top . The most common are metal , plastic , and wood . It is classified as being an aerophone .",
  "long_doc_set": "Playing that first note is very difficult for a lot of people , and plenty of people never even get past that particular stage . The fine tuning is done by a small lever that is adjusted by a small thumb screw . The mouthpieces for some woodwinds , including the clarinet , oboe and bassoon , use a thin piece of wood called a reed , which vibrates when you blow across it . And it has been exasperatingly hard to find photos of the new mouthpieces . To play the flute you hold it sideways , set your lips as if you were about to whistle , and then blow across the air hole ."

  "question": "How can we set a date to the beginning or end of an artistic period ? Does n't the change happen gradually ? --T-- ",
  "answer": "The exact beginning or end date of artistic periods that are taught in school are mostly arbitrary . Art historians usually try to use a major event or the creation of an art piece that features characteristics of the new period , or the death of a representative character . For example , the Baroque period is widely thought to start with the first representation of the first Baroque opera , l'Orfeo , in 1607 , and end with the death of its most famous composer , Johann Sebastian Bach , in 1750 . However , musical styles had actually started changing long before Bach passed away , and were already exhibiting features of what was to become known as the Classical period . In general these dates are mostly just a way to remember which period came after which and what decades they cover .",

  "question": "What happens when wine ages ? How does it make the wine taste better ? --T-- ",
  "answer": "When wine ages , a chemical reaction is occurring within the wine . This chemical reaction changes the flavor to make it taste better , and can also affect the color and how it feels inside your mouth . Not all wine tastes better with age , though . There is a specific compound in wine called tannin that has a big effect on what the wine is going to taste like after aging . Different wines have different amounts of these tannins , so not all wine will taste equally better after aging .",

  "question": "Why were the main predators in New Zealand large birds , compared to other places in the world ? --T-- ",
  "answer": "I 'm not 100 % sure about this , but I 'll try . Since New Zealand is an island , it 's possible that many mammalian species could not access it . There are mammals that can swim to the island that are present , for example seals or whales . Over time , the ecological niche that mammals often occupy were filled by birds . Without traditional predators that often preyed on birds , the bird population grew and actually a lot of these birds were flightless . For the part about large birds --- I think because birds that were prey animals were getting larger , for example the Moa , the predators that ate them also got larger over time , for example the Haast eagle .",
  "short_doc_set": "Until humans began to arrive on our shores 700 odd years ago New Zealand 's only land mammals were small bats , so our native species evolved over millions of years without land mammals . Photo : jokertrekker On top of that , instead of running away when they \u2019re in danger , our birds have evolved to stay still and rely on camouflage to avoid being seen . The New Zealand government hopes ridding the nation of predators will help native birds , including the kiwi . One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago , there were no large land predators in New Zealand . The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.[3",

  "answer": "Herbivores only eat plants , but unlike humans they have special digestive systems that let them get protein from grass . Plants contain cellulose , which is difficult for humans to digest .
